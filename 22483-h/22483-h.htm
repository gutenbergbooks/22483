<h2><a name="I_PREFACE" id="I_PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">South</span> America is, to my mind, "the Coming
Continent"&mdash;the Continent of the future. Everybody knows
the wealth of the Argentine, Peru, Chile, and Bolivia;
but the interior of Brazil, the largest and richest
country of all, not unlike forbidden Tibet, was perhaps
better known a century or two ago than now. Few
people realize that Brazil is larger than the United
States of North America, Germany, Portugal, and a
few other countries taken together. The interior is
practically a <i>terra incognita</i>&mdash;although the ancient
Jesuits and, at a later date, escaped slaves and native
rubber collectors have perhaps found their way inland
to a considerable distance.</p>

<p>When I started on the transcontinental journey I
did not take Europeans with me. It is not easy to
find men who can stand the strain of so long a journey.
I was also not surprised, although I was disappointed,
not to be able to obtain suitable officers in Brazil to
go part of the journey with me, so that I might be
relieved of a portion of the tedious scientific work of
the expedition, especially taking and computing daily
astronomical observations, to which much time has
to be devoted. All the work of all kinds eventually
fell upon my shoulders, and after departing I found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-vi" id="Pg_1-vi"></a>[<a href="images/1-vi.png">vi</a>]</span>
myself filling the posts of surveyor, hydrographer,
cartographer, geologist, meteorologist, anthropologist,
botanist, doctor, veterinary surgeon, painter, photographer,
boat-builder, guide, navigator, etc. The muleteers
who accompanied me&mdash;only six, all counted&mdash;were
of little help to me&mdash;perhaps the reverse. So
that, considering all the adventures and misfortunes we
had, I am sure the reader, after perusing this book,
will wonder that we got back at all, and will be indulgent
enough to give me a little credit for saving, through
innumerable disasters&mdash;and perhaps not altogether by
mere luck&mdash;all my photographs (800 of them), all my
note-books, all my scientific observations, as well as
all the vocabularies I made of the various Indian
languages of tribes found on my way. Also for bringing
all my men out alive.</p>

<p>Here are, briefly, a few results of the expedition:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) First of all it has proved that, far from South
America's being an impenetrable continent&mdash;as was
believed&mdash;it is possible for any experienced traveller
to cross Brazil in any direction, if he could obtain
suitable followers.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) It has proved that the "millions of savage
Indians" supposed to be swarming all over the interior
of Brazil do not exist at all. All the pure Indians of
Central Brazil taken together may number a few
hundreds, or including half-castes (negroes and Portuguese),
a few thousands. As for the wild beasts and
snakes, no one ever need fear being troubled by them.
They are more afraid of you than you of them, you can
take my word for it. So that the terror which has
so far prevented people penetrating the interior has no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-vii" id="Pg_1-vii"></a>[<a href="images/1-vii.png">vii</a>]</span>
reasonable ground, and this book ought to be the means
of making European people some day swarm to develop
that marvellous land now absolutely uninhabited.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Meteorological observations were recorded daily
right across Brazil.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Altitude observations, forming a complete chain
and including all minor undulations, were registered
across the entire South American continent from the
Atlantic coast at Rio de Janeiro as far as Callao on the
Pacific coast. The observations were taken with a
hypsometer and several excellent aneroids. These
show that many of the elevations marked on the
existing maps of Brazil are inaccurate, the error amounting
sometimes to several hundred feet.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) A complete survey was made of new country
between the Araguaya river and the Madeira, including
a careful survey of the Arinos river and the river
Arinos-Juruena, one of the most powerful tributaries of
the Amazon. In the small map, reproduced from the
best existing maps, at the end of the first volume,
several high mountain ranges, quite as high as the
Andes, may be noticed extending from north to south
between the rivers Madeira, Tapajoz, Xingu, Araguaya
and Tocantins. Those high ranges are merely the
work of imaginative cartographers, who have drawn
them to make the map look pretty. They do not
exist. I have left them in order to draw the attention
of the reader to them. The position of the Arinos-Juruena
is from 1 to 1&frac12; degrees farther west than it
is there drawn, and should be where I have marked the
red line of my route.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Everything that was of interest pictorially,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-viii" id="Pg_1-viii"></a>[<a href="images/1-viii.png">viii</a>]</span>
geologically, botanically, or anthropologically was photographed
or sketched. Astronomical observations were
constantly taken to determine the positions of our
camps and places of importance.</p>

<p>Botanical and geological collections were made,
but unfortunately had to be abandoned.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) During the journey the head waters of the
following important rivers were visited: The Rio
Vermelho, Rio Claro, Rio Araguaya, Rio Barreiros,
Rio das Mortes, Rio S. Louren&ccedil;o, the Cuyaba river,
the Xingu, the Paranatinga, the Paraguay river
(Paran&aacute;), the Rio Arinos, the Secundury.</p>

<p>(<i>h</i>) The entire course of the river Tapajoz was
studied, and also the entire course of the Amazon from
its mouth almost to its birthplace in the Andes.</p>

<p>(<i>i</i>) Useful vocabularies were drawn up of the
following Indian languages: Bororo, Apiacar, Mundurucu,
Campas or Antis.</p>

<p>(<i>k</i>) The expedition has furthermore shown that it
is possible with poor material in the way of followers
to accomplish work of unusual difficulty.</p>

<p>(<i>l</i>) That it is possible for people in a normal condition
of health to go at least sixteen days without
food while doing hard work.</p>

<p>(<i>m</i>) That it is possible to cross an entire continent&mdash;for
one entire year&mdash;in the company of dangerous and
lazy criminals without any weapon for protection&mdash;not
even a penknife&mdash;and to bring forth from such poor
material remarkable qualities of endurance, courage, and
almost superhuman energy.</p>

<p>(<i>n</i>) Last, but not least, on that expedition I was
able to collect further evidence that a theory I had long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-ix" id="Pg_1-ix"></a>[<a href="images/1-ix.png">ix</a>]</span>
held as to the present shape of the earth was correct.
I had never believed in the well-known theory that
a continent, now submerged, once existed between
America, Europe and Africa&mdash;in other words, where
the Atlantic Ocean is now. That theory has found
many followers. In support of it one is told that such
islands as Madeira, the Canaries, the Azores, are the
topmost peaks of a now partly submerged range of
mountains which once stood upon that vanished continent.
It is also a common belief that Northern Africa
underwent the contrary process, and was pushed up
from under the sea. That is why&mdash;it is said&mdash;the
Sahara Desert, which was formerly, without doubt,
an ocean bed, is now dry and above water.</p>

<p>One has only to look at any map of the entire world
to see what really happened to the earth in days long
gone by. Let me first of all tell you that there never
existed a continent between Africa and South America.
In fact, I doubt whether there is as much as a square
mile between those two continents more submerged
to-day than it was thousands upon thousands of years
ago.</p>

<p>Here is what really happened. The earth at one
period changed its shape&mdash;when, is merely guesswork,
and is of no consequence here&mdash;and the crust of the
earth&mdash;not the core, mind you&mdash;split into two great
gaps from Pole to Pole, with a number of other minor
fissures. In other words, the earth opened just like
the skin of an over-heated baked apple. The African
and American continents, as well as Australasia, with
New Guinea, the Celebes Islands, the Philippine Archipelago
and China, which before that event formed part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-x" id="Pg_1-x"></a>[<a href="images/1-x.png">x</a>]</span>
of one immense continent, thus became divided, leaving
North and South America isolated, between the two
great Oceans&mdash;the Atlantic and the Pacific&mdash;which
were then, and only then, formed.</p>

<p>It is easy, by looking intelligently at a map, to
reconstruct the former shape of the world. You will
notice that the most western portion of Africa fits
exactly into the gap between North and South America,
while the entire African coast between Dahomey and
the Cape Colony fits in perfectly in all its indentations
and projections into the coast line of South America.
The shores of Western Europe in those days were
joined to North America, and find to-day their almost
parallel and well-fitting coast line on the east coast of
the United States and Canada. On the opposite side
of the world, the western side of South America, the
same conditions can be noticed, although the division
of the two continents (America and Asia) is there much
wider. Fragments were formed, leaving innumerable
islands scattered in the Pacific Ocean, half-way between
the actual continents of Asia, Australia and America.
A mere glance is sufficient to see how well Australia
fits in along the Chilian and Peruvian coast, the great
island of New Guinea along part of Peru and Ecuador,
and the west coast of the Central American Isthmus.
The Philippine Islands lay probably in those days
alongside of Guatemala, while California bordered on
Japan.</p>

<p>Such immense rivers as the Amazon, and its portentous
tributaries flowing from south to north, were
also formed perhaps at that time, great fissures caused
by the sudden splitting and cooling of the earth's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-xi" id="Pg_1-xi"></a>[<a href="images/1-xi.png">xi</a>]</span>
crust becoming the river beds. So perhaps was formed
the giant ca&ntilde;on of Colorado and the immense fissures
in the earth's crust that occur in Central Asia, in
Central Africa, and, as we shall see, on the central
plateau of Brazil.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the Antarctic continent was once
joined to South America, Australia and Africa. During
the last Antarctic expeditions it has been shown that
the same geological formation exists in South America
as in the Antarctic plateau. On perusing this book,
the reader will be struck by the wonderful resemblance
between the Indians of South America, the Malay
races of Asia, and the tribes of Polynesia. I maintain
that they not only resemble each other, but are actually
the same people in different stages of development,
and naturally influenced to a certain extent by climatic
and other local conditions. Those people did not come
there, as has been supposed, by marching up the entire
Asiatic coast, crossing over the Behring Straits and
then down the American coast, nor by means of any
other migration. No, indeed; it is not they who have
moved, but it is the country under them which has
shifted and separated them, leaving members of the
same race thousands of miles apart.</p>

<p>I was able to notice among the Indians of Central
Brazil many words of Malay origin, others closely
resembling words of languages current among tribes of
the Philippine Islands. The anthropometric measurements
which I took of South American Indians corresponded
almost exactly with those of natives of the
Sulu Archipelago and the island of Mindanao.</p>

<p>I hope some day to use the wealth of material I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-xii" id="Pg_1-xii"></a>[<a href="images/1-xii.png">xii</a>]</span>
have collected among innumerable tribes on the Asiatic
coast, on the islands of the Pacific Ocean, in South
America and in Africa, in making a comparative study
of those peoples. It should prove interesting enough.
I have no space here to go deeply into the subject, as
this is merely a book descriptive of South America. I
may add that the most ardent supporter of the above
theory is the celebrated explorer and scientist, Colonel
Marchand, of Fashoda fame&mdash;a man who has studied
and understands the mysteries of this world better
than any man living.</p>

<p>My sincere thanks are due to the following gentlemen
for much politeness shown me in connection with the
expedition: To Mr. Gustave Babin, the famous writer
of Paris; to Mr. Manoel Bomfin (ex-deputy of Brazil),
to Senador Alcindo Guanabara, for the keen interest
taken in the expedition and for proposing to Congress
after my return that a grant of &pound;4,000 should be given
to me as a reward for the work done. I herewith also
express my gratitude to the Brazilian Government for
paying me that sum, which came in usefully to defray
part of the expenses of the expedition. To H.E. Dr.
Pedro de Toledo, Minister of Agriculture, for the
intelligent desire shown to help as much as he could
in the venture, and for kindly giving me the free use
of all the telegraphs in Brazil, including the Amazon
Cable, and other important privileges; to Dr. Jos&eacute;
Carlos Rodriguez for hospitality and much valuable
advice; to Dr. Paolo de Frontin, Conseilheiro Antonio
Prado, Dr. Jos&eacute; Pereira Rebon&ccedil;as and Mr. Mockill
and their respective Companies for the many privileges
granted me upon the various railways of which they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-xiii" id="Pg_1-xiii"></a>[<a href="images/1-xiii.png">xiii</a>]</span>
were the Presidents; to Colonel R. E. Brazil and
Commandante Macedo for their kind hospitality to
me while navigating the lower Tapajoz river; to Dr.
A. B. Leguia, President of the Peruvian Republic;
to the British Ministers at Petropolis, Lima, La Paz,
and Buenos Ayres, and the British Consuls of Rio de
Janeiro, Par&aacute;, Manaos, Iquitos, Antofogasta, Valparaiso;
finally to the British and American Residents at all
those places for much exquisite hospitality offered me.</p>

<p>Special thanks are due to Mr. Regis de Oliveira,
ex-Brazilian Minister in London, for valuable credentials
given me before my departure which paved the
way to the hearty reception I received everywhere
in Brazil.</p>

<h2><a name="I_CHAPTER_I" id="I_CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Heart of Brazil&mdash;Brazil, its Size and its Immense Wealth&mdash;Rio de
Janeiro&mdash;Brazilian Men of Genius&mdash;S&atilde;o Paulo&mdash;The <i>Bandeirantes</i>&mdash;The
Paulista Railway</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"<span class="smcap">More</span> than three months to reach the spot?" asked
the cinematograph man in amazement. "Then perhaps
Monsieur is on a journey to Mars or the moon!
There is no spot on earth that takes so long to reach."
(Hearty laughter at his own wit.)</p>

<p>That exclamation, and wise words that follow, came
from the assistant of one of the largest firms of cinematograph
appliances in Paris, where I had called in
order to purchase a moving picture apparatus and
10,000 metres of film to be used on my forthcoming
journey across the South American continent.</p>

<p>The shop assistant had very honestly warned me
that if the films were to be used in a damp, tropical
climate, they must be exposed and developed within
three months of their manufacture. After that time
they would become so perforated and fogged as to
be quite useless. I had remarked that it would take
me more than three months to reach the spot where
I should begin to take cinematograph pictures.</p>

<p>"Will Monsieur please tell where is the spot where
he would be likely to use the films?" continued the
assistant, still overcome with surprise.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-2" id="Pg_1-2"></a>[<a href="images/1-2.png">2</a>]</span>
"In the heart of Brazil."</p>

<p>"In the heart of Brazil ... in the very heart of
Brazil?... <i>Oh, mon Dieu! mon Dieu!</i>" (More
laughter and a look of compassion at me.) "<i>Mais
nous avons une de nos maisons tout &agrave; fait pr&egrave;s de l&agrave;!</i>"
(Why, indeed, we have one of our factories quite close
to there.)</p>

<p>It was then my turn for hearty laughter and the
look of compassion.</p>

<p>"Pray," I inquired, "tell me more exactly. Where
is your factory close to the heart of Brazil?"</p>

<p>"It is quite, quite close. It is in Montreal, Canada.... You
will send your films there ... two or three
days' journey.... It will take us a week to develop
them ... two or three days for their return journey.
In a fortnight you will have them back again."</p>

<p>Quite close, indeed: only a distance of some 65&deg;
of latitude&mdash;or some 7170 kilometres as the crow flies&mdash;with
no direct communication by land or water!</p>

<p>That was the Frenchman's knowledge of geography;
but I find that the average Englishman, unless he is
directly interested in those countries, knows little
better, and perhaps even less. Time after time I have
been asked in London if Brazil were not a province
of Mexico, and whether it is not through Brazil that
the Americans are cutting the Panama Canal! There
are many who have a vague idea that Brazil is a German
colony; others, more patriotic, who claim it as an
English possession. Many of those who have looked
at the map of the world are under the impression that
Spanish is spoken in Brazil, and are surprised when
you tell them that Portuguese happens to be the local<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-3" id="Pg_1-3"></a>[<a href="images/1-3.png">3</a>]</span>
language. Others, more enlightened in their geography
by that great play <i>Charley's Aunt</i>, imagine it a great
forest of nut trees. Others, more enlightened still,
believe it to be a land where you are constantly walking
in avenues adorned with wonderful orchids, with a
sky overhead swarming with birds of beautiful plumage.
I have been asked in all seriousness whether I found
the Andes quite flat&mdash;great prairies (the person had
heard of the Argentine <i>pampas</i> and got mixed up)&mdash;or
whether "it" was merely a large lagoon!</p>

<p>I could quote dozens more of these extreme cases
of ignorance, but of one thing I am certain, and that
is, that there are few people in the British Isles who
realize the actual size of the great Brazilian Republic.</p>

<p>Brazil is 8,524,778 square kilometres&mdash;with the
territory of the Acre newly acquired from Bolivia,
8,715,778 sq. kil. in extent; that is to say, it covers
an area larger than the United States of North America,
Germany, Portugal, Greece and Montenegro taken
together.</p>

<p>Some of the States of the Republic are larger
than some of the largest countries in Europe: such
as the State of the Amazonas with 1,894,724 sq. kil.;
the State of Matto Grosso with 1,378,784 sq. kil.; the
State of Par&aacute; with an area of 1,149,712 sq. kil.; the
State of Goyaz with 747,311 sq. kil.; the State of
Minas Geraes with 574,855 sq. kil.; the Acre territory,
191,000 sq. kil.</p>

<p>There are fewer people still who seriously appreciate
the great importance of that beautiful country&mdash;with no
exception the richest, the most wonderful in the world;
to my mind undoubtedly the continent of the future.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-4" id="Pg_1-4"></a>[<a href="images/1-4.png">4</a>]</span>
Incalculable is the richness of Brazil in mineral
wealth. Magnificent yellow diamonds are to be found
in various regions, those of Minas Geraes and Matto
Grosso being famous for their purity and extraordinary
brilliancy; agates, moonstones, amethysts, emeralds,
sapphires, rubies, topazes, and all kinds of beautiful
rock crystals are plentiful. Gold exists in many regions
on the central plateau&mdash;but particularly in Minas
Geraes and Matto Grosso; and platinum in the States
of S&atilde;o Paulo, Minas Geraes, Sta. Catharina and Espirito
Santo; silver, mercury, lead, tin, salicylated and
natural copper are found in many places, as well as
graphite, iron, magnetic iron, oxide of copper, antimony,
argentiferous galena, malachite, manganese oxide, alum,
bituminous schist, anthracite, phosphate of lime,
sulphate of sodium, h&aelig;matite, monazitic sands (the
latter in large quantities), nitrate of potassium, yellow,
rose-coloured, and opalescent quartz, sulphate of iron,
sulphate of magnesia, potash, kaolin. Coal and lignite
of poor quality have been discovered in some regions,
and also petroleum, but not in large quantities.</p>

<p class="fsc">Rio de Janeiro, showing the beautiful Avenida Central.</p>
<hr />
<p>Springs of thermal and mineral waters are numerous&mdash;particularly
those of which the waters are sulphurous
or ferruginous; others contain arsenic and magnesia.</p>

<p>Most beautiful marble of various colours is to be
found, and also enormous quantities of mica and
amianth; porphyry and porphyroid granite, carbonated
and hydroxided iron, argillaceous schist, mica
schist.</p>

<p>Even richer than the mineral wealth is the botanical
wealth, hitherto dormant, of Brazil. Valuable woods
occur in many Brazilian forests&mdash;although it must not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-5" id="Pg_1-5"></a>[<a href="images/1-5.png">5</a>]</span>
for one moment be imagined that entire forests are
to be found composed of useful woods. Indeed this
is not the case. Most of the woods are absolutely
valueless. Still, when it is realized that the forests of
Brazil extend for several millions of square kilometres,
it is easy to conceive that there is plenty of room among
a majority of poor trees for some good ones. Most
Brazilian woods are interesting on account of their
high specific gravity. Few, very few, will float on
water. On the central plateau, for instance, I could
not find a single wood which floated&mdash;barring, under
special conditions, the burity palm (<i>Mauritia vinifera</i>
M.). Along the banks of the Amazon and in the
northern part of Brazil this is not quite the case.
Some Brazilian woods, such as the iron-tree (pao-ferro),
whose name fitly indicates its character, are of extraordinary
hardness. The Brazilian forest, although
not specially rich in woods for building and naval
purposes, is nevertheless most abundant in lactiferous,
oliferous, fibrous, medicinal, resinous, and industrial
plants&mdash;such for instance as can be used for tanning
purposes, etc. No country in the world is as rich as
Brazil in its natural growth of rubber trees; nor have
I ever seen anywhere else such beautiful and plentiful
palms: the piassava (<i>Attalia fumifera</i> M.), the assahy
(<i>Euterpe oleracea</i> L.), the burity (<i>Mauritia vinifera</i> M.),
the carnahuberia (<i>Copernicia cerifera</i> M.), the palmito
(<i>Euterpe edulis</i> M.), and many others. I shall give a
more detailed description of the most important of
these plants as we proceed on our journey and find
them in their habitat.</p>

<p>Where, perhaps, Brazil's greatest richness lies is in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-6" id="Pg_1-6"></a>[<a href="images/1-6.png">6</a>]</span>
its hundreds of thousands of square miles of wonderful
pasture lands&mdash;perfectly ideal, with plenty of excellent
water and a delicious climate&mdash;capable of some day fattening
enough cattle to supply half the world with meat.</p>

<p>All these wonderful riches are absolutely dormant;
more than that, absolutely wasted for lack of population,
for lack of roads, trails, railways, or navigation
of the rivers. The coast of Brazil is highly civilized,
and so, more or less, is the immediate neighbourhood
of large cities; but the moment you leave those
cities, or the narrow zone along the few hundred kilometres
of railways which now exist, you immediately
relapse into the Middle Ages. When you get beyond
the comparatively narrow belt of semi-civilization,
along the coast, Brazil is almost as unknown as Mars
or the moon. The people who know least the country
are, curiously enough, the Brazilians themselves.
Owing greatly to racial apathy, they care little for the
trouble of developing their beautiful land. They watch
with envy strangers taking gold, diamonds, platinum,
and precious stones out of their country. They accuse
foreigners of going there to rob them of their wealth;
yet you seldom meet a Brazilian who will venture out
of a city to go and help himself. The Brazilian Government
is now beginning to wake up to the fact that it
is the possessor of the most magnificent country on
earth, and it is its wish to endeavour to develop it;
but the existing laws, made by short-sighted politicians,
are considered likely to hamper development for many
years to come.</p>

<p>Brazil is not lacking in intelligent men. Indeed, I
met in Rio de Janeiro and S. Paulo men who would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-7" id="Pg_1-7"></a>[<a href="images/1-7.png">7</a>]</span>
be remarkable anywhere. Councillor Antonio Prado of
S. Paulo, for instance, was a genius who had done
wonders for his country. The great development of
the State of S. Paulo compared with other States is
chiefly due to that great patriot. Then the Baron de
Rio Branco&mdash;the shrewd diplomatist, who has lately
died&mdash;has left a monument of good work for his country.
The cession of the immensely rich tract of the Acre
Territory by Bolivia to Brazil is in itself a wonderful
achievement. Dr. Pedro de Toledo, the present
Minister of Agriculture, is a practical, well-enlightened,
go-ahead gentleman, who makes superhuman efforts,
and in the right direction, in order to place his country
among the leading states of the two Americas. Dr.
Lauro Severiano M&uuml;ller, the new Minister of Foreign
Affairs, is a worthy successor of Baron de Rio Branco.
There are many other persons of positive genius, such
as Senator Alcindo Guanabara, a man of remarkable
literary ability, and one of the few men in Brazil who
realize thoroughly the true wants of the Republic, a
man of large views, who is anxious to see his country
opened up and properly developed. Another remarkable
man is Dr. Jos&eacute; Carlos Rodriguez, the proprietor of
the leading newspaper in Rio&mdash;the <i>Jornal do Commercio</i>&mdash;and
the organizing genius of some of the most important
Brazilian commercial ventures. Having had an
American and English education, Dr. Rodriguez has been
able to establish in Rio the best edited and produced
daily newspaper in the world. Its complete service of
telegraphic news from all over the globe&mdash;on a scale
which no paper, even in England, can equal or even
approach&mdash;the moderate tone and seriousness of its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-8" id="Pg_1-8"></a>[<a href="images/1-8.png">8</a>]</span>
leading articles, its highly reliable and instructive
columns on all possible kinds of subjects by a specially
able staff of the cleverest writers in Brazil, and the
refined style in which it is printed, do great honour
to Dr. Rodriguez. Then comes another man of genius&mdash;Dr.
Francisco Pereira Passos, who, with Dr. Paulo
de Frontin, has been able in a few years to transform
Rio de Janeiro from one of the dirtiest and ugliest
cities in South America into the most beautiful. The
great drive around the beautiful bay, the spacious
new Avenida Central&mdash;with its parallel avenues of
great width&mdash;the construction of a magnificently
appointed municipal theatre, the heavenly road along
the Tijuca mountains encircling and overlooking the
great harbour, and a thousand other improvements of
the city are due to those two men. Dr. Paulo Frontin
has also been active in developing the network of
railways in Brazil. Whatever he has undertaken, he
has accomplished with great judgment and skill.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill1-8.jpg"><img src="images/ill1-8_th.jpg" alt="Rio de Janeiro as it was in 1903." title="Rio de Janeiro as it was in 1903." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Rio de Janeiro as it was in 1903.</p>
<hr />
<p>It would be impossible to enumerate here all the
clever men of Brazil. They are indeed too numerous.
The older generation has worked at great disadvantage
owing to the difficulty of obtaining proper education.
Many are the illiterate or almost illiterate people one
finds even among the better classes. Now, however,
excellent and most up-to-date schools have been
established in the principal cities, and with the great
enthusiasm and natural facility in learning of the
younger generations wonderful results have been obtained.
On account partly of the exhausting climate
and the indolent life that Brazilians are inclined to
lead, a good deal of the enthusiasm of youth dies out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-9" id="Pg_1-9"></a>[<a href="images/1-9.png">9</a>]</span>
in later years; still Brazil has in its younger generation
a great many men who are ambitious and heartily
wish to render their country service. It is to be hoped
that their efforts may be crowned with success. It is
not talent which is lacking in Brazil, it is not patriotism;
but persistence is not perhaps the chief characteristic
among races of Portuguese descent. In these days of
competition it is difficult to accomplish anything great
without labour and trouble.</p>

<p>I left London on December 23rd, 1910, by the Royal
Mail steamship <i>Amazon</i>, one of the most comfortable
steamers I have ever been on.</p>

<p>We touched at Madeira, Pernambuco, and then at
Bahia. Bahia seen from the sea was quite picturesque,
with its two horizontal lines of buildings, one on the
summit of a low hill-range, the other along the water
line. A border of deep green vegetation separated the
lower from the upper town. A massive red building
stood prominent almost in the centre of the upper
town, and also a number of church towers, the high
dome of a church crowning the highest point.</p>

<p>I arrived in Rio de Janeiro on January 9th, 1911.</p>

<p>It is no use my giving a description of the city of
Rio de Janeiro. Everybody knows that it is&mdash;from
a pictorial point of view&mdash;quite a heavenly spot. Few
seaside cities on earth can expect to have such a glorious
background of fantastic mountains, and at the same
time be situated on one of the most wonderful harbours
known. I have personally seen a harbour which was
quite as strangely interesting as the Rio harbour&mdash;but
there was no city on it. It was the Malampaya Sound,
on the Island of Palawan (Philippine Archipelago).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-10" id="Pg_1-10"></a>[<a href="images/1-10.png">10</a>]</span>
But such an <i>ensemble</i> of Nature's wonderful work
combined with man's cannot, to the best of my knowledge,
be found anywhere else than in Rio.</p>

<p>It does not do to examine everything too closely in
detail when you land&mdash;for while there are buildings of
beautiful architectural lines, there are others which suggest
the work of a pastrycook. To any one coming direct
from Europe some of the statuary by local talent which
adorns the principal squares gives a severe shock.
Ladies in evening dress and naked cupids in bronze
flying through national flags flapping in the wind,
half of their bodies on one side, the other half on the
other side of the flags, look somewhat grotesque as you
approach the statues from behind. But Rio is not the
only place where you see grotesque statuary&mdash;you have
not to go far from or even out of London to receive
similar and worse shocks. If Rio has some bad statues
it also possesses some remarkably beautiful ones by
the sculptor Bernardelli&mdash;a wonderful genius who is
now at the head of the Academy of Fine Arts in Rio.
This man has had a marvellous influence in the beautifying
of the city, and to him are due the impressive
lines of the finest buildings in Rio, such as the Academy
of Fine Arts. Naturally, in a young country like
Brazil&mdash;I am speaking of new Brazil, now wide awake,
not of the Brazil which has been asleep for some decades&mdash;perfection
cannot be reached in everything in one
day. It is really marvellous how much the Brazilians
have been able to accomplish during the last ten years
or so in their cities, on or near the coast.</p>

<p>Brazilians have their own way of thinking, which
is not ours, and which is to us almost incomprehensible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-11" id="Pg_1-11"></a>[<a href="images/1-11.png">11</a>]</span>
They are most indirect in their thoughts and deeds&mdash;a
characteristic which is purely racial, and which they
themselves cannot appreciate, but which often shocks
Europeans. For instance, one of the most palatial
buildings in the Avenida Central was built only a
short time ago. In it, as became such an up-to-date
building, was established a lift. But do you think that
the architect, like all other architects anywhere else
in the world, would make the lift start from the ground
floor? No, indeed. The lift only starts from the
second floor up&mdash;and, if I remember rightly, you have
to walk some thirty-eight steps up a grand staircase
before you reach it! Do you know why? Because
the architect wished to compel all visitors to the
building to admire a window of gaudy coloured glass
half-way up the staircase. In this way they reason
about nearly everything. They have not yet mastered
the importance and due proportion of detail. Frequently
what is to us a trifling detail is placed by them
in the forefront as the most important point of whatever
they undertake.</p>

<p>Thanks to the strong credentials I carried&mdash;among
which were letters from H.E. Regis de Oliveira, Brazilian
Minister in London&mdash;I was received in Rio de Janeiro
with the utmost consideration and kindness. From the
President of the Republic to the humblest citizens,
all with no exception treated me with charming
civility. My stay in Rio was a delightful one. The
Brazilians of the principal cities were most courteous
and accomplished, and it was a great pleasure to
associate with them. Intense interest was shown by
the Government of the country and by the people in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-12" id="Pg_1-12"></a>[<a href="images/1-12.png">12</a>]</span>
my plan to cross the continent. Dr. Pedro de Toledo,
the Minister of Agriculture, was specially interested
in the scheme, and it was at first suggested that the
expedition should be an Anglo-Brazilian one, and that
I should be accompanied by Brazilian officers and
soldiers. Colonel Rondon, a well-known and brave
officer, was ordered by the Government to find suitable
volunteers in the army to accompany my expedition.
After a long delay, Colonel Rondon informed me that
his search had been unsuccessful. Colonel Rondon said
he would have gladly accompanied the expedition himself,
had he not been detained in Rio by his duties as
Chief of the Bureau for the Protection and Civilization
of the Indians. Another officer offered his services in
a private capacity, but he having become involved in
a lawsuit, the negotiations were suddenly interrupted.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill1-12.jpg"><img src="images/ill1-12_th.jpg" alt="Dr. Pedro de Toledo, Minister of Agriculture, Brazil." title="Dr. Pedro de Toledo, Minister of Agriculture, Brazil." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Dr. Pedro de Toledo, Minister of Agriculture, Brazil.</p>
<hr />
<p>I endeavoured to find suitable civilians. No one
would go. The Brazilian forest, they all said, was
worse, more impenetrable than any forest in the world.
Brazilian rivers were broader, deeper and more dangerous
than any river on earth. Wild beasts in Brazil
were more numerous and wilder than the wildest animals
of Africa or Asia. As for the Indians of Central Brazil,
they were innumerable&mdash;millions of them&mdash;and ferocious
beyond all conception. They were treacherous cannibals,
and unfortunate was the person who ventured
among them. They told stories galore of how the few
who had gone had never come back. Then the insects,
the climate, the terrible diseases of Central Brazil were
worse than any insect, any climate, any terrible disease
anywhere. That is more or less the talk one hears in
every country when about to start on an expedition.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-13" id="Pg_1-13"></a>[<a href="images/1-13.png">13</a>]</span>
I had prepared my expedition carefully, at a cost
of some &pound;2,000 for outfit. Few private expeditions
have ever started better equipped. I carried ample
provisions for one year (tinned meats, vegetables,
1,000 boxes of sardines, fruits, jams, biscuits, chocolate,
cocoa, coffee, tea, etc.), two serviceable light tents, two
complete sets of instruments for astronomical and
meteorological observations, and all the instruments
necessary for making an accurate survey of the country
traversed. Four excellent aneroids&mdash;which had been
specially constructed for me&mdash;and a well-made hypsometrical
apparatus with six boiling-point thermometers,
duly tested at the Kew Observatory, were carried in
order to determine accurately the altitudes observed.
Then I possessed two prismatic and six other excellent
compasses, chronometers, six photographic cameras,
specially made for me, with the very best Zeiss and
Goertz lenses, and some 1,400 glass photographic
plates&mdash;including some for colour photography. All
articles liable to be injured by heat and damp were
duly packed in air- and water-tight metal cases with
outer covers of wood. Then I carried all the instruments
necessary for anthropometric work, and painting
materials for recording views and scenes in colours when
the camera could not be used, as at night or when the
daylight was insufficient. I had a complete supply of
spades, picks, large saws, axes, and heavy-bladed knives
(two feet long) for cutting our way through the forest,
making roads and constructing rafts, canoes and
temporary bridges.</p>

<p>I carried, as usual, very little medicine&mdash;merely
three gallons of castor oil, a few bottles of iodine, some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-14" id="Pg_1-14"></a>[<a href="images/1-14.png">14</a>]</span>
formiate of quinine, strong carbolic and arsenical soaps,
permanganate and other powerful disinfectants, caustic&mdash;that
was about all. These medicines were mostly
to be used, if necessary, upon my men and not upon
myself.</p>

<p>I had twelve of the best repeating rifles that are
made, as well as excellent automatic pistols of the most
modern type, and several thousand rounds of ammunition&mdash;chiefly
soft-nosed bullets. These weapons were
carried in order to arm my followers. Although I had
several first-class rifles for my own use&mdash;following my
usual custom, I never myself carried any weapons&mdash;not
even a penknife&mdash;upon my person except when
actually going after game. Again on this occasion&mdash;as
on previous journeys&mdash;I did not masquerade about
in fancy costumes such as are imagined to be worn by
explorers, with straps and buckles and patent arrangements
all over. I merely wore a sack coat with ample
pockets, over long trousers such as I use in town. Nor
did I wear any special boots. I always wore comfortable
clothes everywhere, and made no difference in my
attire between the Brazilian forest and Piccadilly,
London. When it got too hot, naturally I removed
the coat and remained in shirt sleeves; but that was
all the difference I ever made in my wearing apparel
between London and Central Brazil. I have never
in my life adopted a sun helmet&mdash;the most absurd,
uncomfortable and grotesque headgear that was ever
invented. I find, personally, that a common straw
hat provides as much protection as any healthy person
requires from the equatorial sun.</p>

<p>If I give these details, it is merely because they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-15" id="Pg_1-15"></a>[<a href="images/1-15.png">15</a>]</span>
might be of some use to others&mdash;not because I wish to
advertise these facts; and also, if I do not give the
names of the firms which supplied the various articles,
it is because&mdash;unlike many other explorers&mdash;I have
been in the custom of never letting my name be used
in any way whatever for advertising purposes.</p>

<p>There are many people who are enthusiastic over
a dangerous project when they first hear of it, but on
thinking it over and talking with friends and relatives
their enthusiasm soon wears off. That is what happened
in Rio. I wasted some time in Rio&mdash;socially most
enjoyably employed&mdash;in order to get followers and come
to some suitable arrangement with the Government.
I was deeply indebted to the Minister of Agriculture,
Dr. Pedro de Toledo, for allowing me the free use
of all the telegraphs in Brazil, and also for a special
permission (of which I never availed myself) to use, if
necessary, the flotilla of Government boats on the
Amazon. Credentials were also furnished me, but
owing to the way in which they were worded they were
more of a danger to me than a protection. They
actually proved to be so once or twice when I was
compelled to present them. The expedition was considered
so dangerous that the Government published
broadcast statements in the official and other papers
stating that "Mr. A. H. Savage Landor's expedition
across Brazil was undertaken solely at his own initiative
and absolutely at his own risk and responsibility."
They also circulated widely the statement that I had
promised not in any way to injure or hurt the native
Indians, that I would not supply them with firearms
of any kind, and that I would in no way ill-treat them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-16" id="Pg_1-16"></a>[<a href="images/1-16.png">16</a>]</span>
I had gladly promised all that. I had not even dreamt
of doing any of those things to the natives, and naturally
I strictly kept my promise.</p>

<p>In a luxurious Administration car placed at my
disposal by Dr. Paulo Frontin I left Rio by the Central
Railway, escorted as far as S. Paulo by Dr. Carlo da
Fonseca, a railway engineer, sent to look after my
comfort by the Central Brazilian Railway Company.</p>

<p>On approaching S. Paulo in the early morning I was
much struck by the activity of the waking city as
compared with Rio. Carts were dashing to and fro
in the streets, the people walked along fast as if they
had something to do, and numerous factory chimneys
ejected clouds of smoke, puffing away in great white
balls. The people stopped to chat away briskly as if
they had some life in them. It seemed almost as if
we had suddenly dropped into an active commercial
European city. The type of people, their ways and
manners were different from those of the people of Rio&mdash;but
equally civil, equally charming to me from the
moment I landed at the handsome railway station.</p>

<p>With a delicious climate&mdash;owing to its elevation&mdash;with
a population of energetic people chiefly of Italian
origin, instead of the apathetic mixture of Portuguese
and negro, S. Paulo was indeed the most flourishing
city of the Brazilian Republic. Its yearly development
was enormous. Architecturally it was gradually
becoming modified and improved, so that in a few
years it will be a very beautiful city indeed. Already
the city possessed beautiful avenues and a wonderful
theatre.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill1-16.jpg"><img src="images/ill1-16_th.jpg" alt="Senador Alcindo Guanabara, a great Literary Genius and Patriot of Brazil." title="Senador Alcindo Guanabara, a great Literary Genius and Patriot of Brazil." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Senador Alcindo Guanabara, a great Literary Genius and Patriot of Brazil.</p>
<hr />
<p>Everybody knows what an important part the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-17" id="Pg_1-17"></a>[<a href="images/1-17.png">17</a>]</span>
enterprising people of S. Paulo have played in the
expansion and colonization of the central and southern
regions of Brazil. The early activity of the Paulistas&mdash;it
dates back to 1531&mdash;can be traced from the River
Plate on the south, to the head waters of the Madeira
in Matto Grosso on the east, and as far as Piantry on
the north.</p>

<p>I cannot indulge here, as I should like to do, in
giving a complete historical sketch of the amazing
daring and enterprise of those early explorers and
adventurers and of their really remarkable achievements.
Their raids extended to territories of South
America which are to-day almost impenetrable. It
was really wonderful how they were able to locate and
exploit many of the most important mines within an
immense radius of their base.</p>

<p>The history of the famous Bandeiras, under the
command of Raposo, and composed of Mamelucos
(crosses of Portuguese and Indians) and Tupy Indians,
the latter a hardy and bold race, which started out on
slave-hunting expeditions, is thrilling beyond words and
reads almost like fiction. The ways of the Bandeirantes
were sinister. They managed to capture immense
numbers of slaves, and must have killed as many as
they were able to bring back or more. They managed,
therefore, to depopulate the country almost entirely,
the few tribes that contrived to escape destruction
seeking refuge farther west upon the slopes of the
Andes.</p>

<p>Although the Brazilians&mdash;even in official statistics&mdash;estimate
the number of pure savage Indians in the
interior at several millions, I think that the readers of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-18" id="Pg_1-18"></a>[<a href="images/1-18.png">18</a>]</span>
this book will be convinced, as I was in my journey
across the widest and wildest part of Brazil, that perhaps
a few hundreds would be a more correct estimate.
Counting half-castes, second, third and fourth crosses,
and Indians who have entirely adopted Portuguese
ways, language and clothes, they may perhaps amount
to several thousand&mdash;but that is all.</p>

<p>The Jesuits endeavoured to save the Indians from
the too-enterprising Bandeirantes, with the result that
the missions were destroyed also and the missionaries
driven away or killed.</p>

<p>Brazil occupies to-day in the world's knowledge
practically the same position that forbidden Tibet
occupied some fifteen or twenty years ago. It was
easier to travel all over Brazil centuries ago than now.</p>

<p>The Bandeirantes became extraordinarily daring.
In 1641 another slave-hunting Paulista expedition
started out to sack the missions of Paraguay and make
great hauls of converted Indians. The adventurers
invaded even the impenetrable territory of the Chaco.
But, history tells us, the Jesuits, who were well prepared
for war, were not only able to trap the 400
Paulista Bandeirantes in an ambuscade and to set
free their prisoners, but killed a great number of them,
120 of the adventurous Bandeirantes thus supplying
a handsome dinner for the cannibal Chaco Indians.
Infuriated at the reverse, the survivors of the expedition
destroyed all the missions and Indian villages
upon their passage, not one escaping. They came to
grief, however, in the end. Few only returned home
to tell the tale. That lesson practically ended the
slave-hunting expeditions on a large scale of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-19" id="Pg_1-19"></a>[<a href="images/1-19.png">19</a>]</span>
Bandeirantes, but not the expeditions of parties in
search of gold and diamonds, many of which were
extraordinarily successful. Minor expeditions were
undertaken in which Paulista adventurers were employed
under contract in various parts of Brazil for
such purposes as to fight the Indians or to break up
the so-called Republic of the Palmeiras&mdash;an unpleasant
congregation of negroes and Indians.</p>

<p>The astonishing success which the dauntless Paulistas
had obtained everywhere made them thirst for
gold and diamonds, which they knew existed in the
interior. They set out in great numbers&mdash;men, women,
and children&mdash;in search of wealth and fresh adventure.
Several of the towns in distant parts of the interior
of Brazil owe their origin to this great band of adventurers,
especially in the section of Brazil now called
Minas Geraes. The adventurers were eventually outnumbered
and overpowered by swarms of Brazilians
from other parts of the country, and by Portuguese
who had quickly arrived in order to share in the wealth
discovered by the Paulistas. They finally had to
abandon the mines which they had conquered at an
appalling loss of human life.</p>

<p>The ardour of the Paulistas was quelled but not
extinguished. About the year 1718 they started afresh
to the north-west in the direction of the Cuyaba River
and of Goyaz, where they had learnt that gold and
diamonds of great beauty were to be found. So many
joined in these adventurous expeditions that S. Paulo
was left almost depopulated. That is how those
immense territories of Goyaz and Matto Grosso were
discovered and annexed to S. Paulo, but eventually,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-20" id="Pg_1-20"></a>[<a href="images/1-20.png">20</a>]</span>
owing to their size, these became split up into <i>capitaneas</i>,
then into states.</p>

<p>The Paulistas were great fighters. In 1739 they
were able to drive away the Spaniards from Rio Grande
do Sul and forced them to retreat into Uruguay. After
many years of vicissitudes in war and exploration&mdash;after
phases of prosperity, oppression, and even of
almost total ruin, owing to maladministration and
official greed&mdash;things began to look up again for S&atilde;o
Paulo when the port of Santos was thrown open to the
trade of the world, in 1808. The history of Brazil
during the last hundred years is too well known to be
repeated here.</p>

<p>During the last few years the State of S&atilde;o Paulo
has attained amazing prosperity, principally from the
export of coffee&mdash;perhaps the most delicious coffee in
the world. Although nearly all the rivers of the State
of S&atilde;o Paulo are absolutely useless for navigation, owing
to dangerous rapids, the State is intersected by innumerable
streams, large and small&mdash;of great importance
for purposes of irrigation and for the generation of
electric power. The most important harbour in the
State is Santos. Ubatuba, S&atilde;o Sebasti&atilde;o, Iguape and
Carranca are ports of less consequence. It is principally
from Santos that the exportation of coffee takes
place.</p>

<p>The State extends roughly in a parallelogram from
the ocean, south-east, to the Parana River, north-west;
between the Rio Grande, to the north, and the Rio
Paranapanema, to the south, the latter being two
tributaries of the Parana River. The State can be
divided into two distinct zones, one comprising the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-21" id="Pg_1-21"></a>[<a href="images/1-21.png">21</a>]</span>
low-lying lands of the littoral, the second the tablelands
of the interior north-west of the Serra Cadias,
Serra do Paranapiacaba and Serra do Mar&mdash;along
or near the sea-coasts. The first zone by the sea is
extremely hot and damp, with swampy and sandy soil
often broken up by spurs from the neighbouring hill
ranges. It is well suited for the cultivation of rice.
The second zone, which covers practically all the
elevated country between the coast ranges and the
Parana River, is extraordinarily fertile, with a fairly
mild climate and abundant rains during the summer
months. During the winter the days are generally
clear and dry.</p>

<p>It is in that second zone that immense coffee
plantations are to be found, the red soil typical of that
tableland being particularly suitable for the cultivation
of the coffee trees.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary here to go into detailed
statistics, but it may be sufficient to state, on the
authority of the Directoria de Estatistica Commercial
of Rio de Janeiro, that during the first eleven months
of the year 1912, 10,465,435 sacks of coffee were exported
from Brazil&mdash;mostly from S&atilde;o Paulo&mdash;showing
an increase of 548,854 sacks on eleven months of the
previous year. That means a sum of &pound;40,516,006
sterling, or &pound;5,218,564 more than the previous year; the
average value of the coffee being, in 1912, 58,071
milreis, or, taking the pound sterling at 15 milreis,
&pound;3 17<i>s.</i> 5&frac12;<i>d.</i> a sack&mdash;an increase in price of 4,628
reis = 6<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> per sack, on the sales of 1911.</p>

<p>The other exports from the State of S&atilde;o Paulo are
flour, mandioca, cassava, bran, tanned hides, horns,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-22" id="Pg_1-22"></a>[<a href="images/1-22.png">22</a>]</span>
fruit (pineapples, bananas, cocoanuts, abacates (alligator
pears), oranges, tangerines, etc.), wax, timber
(chiefly jacarand&agrave; or rosewood), a yearly decreasing
quantity of cotton, steel and iron, mica, goldsmith's
dust, dried and preserved fish, scrap sole leather,
salted and dry hides, wool, castor seed or bean, crystal,
<i>mate</i>, rice, sugar, rum (<i>aguardente</i>) and other articles
of minor importance.</p>

<p>The area of the State of S&atilde;o Paulo has been put
down at 290,876 sq. kil.</p>

<p>Its population in 1908 was calculated at 3,397,000,
and it had then more inhabitants to the square kilometre
than any other part of Brazil. It is useless to
give actual figures of the population, for none are
reliable. Although this State is the most civilized in
Brazil, yet a good portion of its western territory is
still practically a <i>terra incognita</i>, so that even the best
official figures are mere guess-work.</p>

<p>Owing to the wonderful foresight of that great man,
Antonio Prado&mdash;to my mind the greatest man in
Brazil&mdash;a new industry has been started in the State
of S&atilde;o Paulo which promises to be as lucrative and
perhaps more so than the cultivation of coffee. It is
the breeding of cattle on a gigantic scale, the magnificent
prairies near Barretos, in the northern part of the
State, being employed for the purpose. Slaughter-houses
and refrigerating plants of the most modern
type are to be established there, and with such a practical
man as Antonio Prado at the head of the enterprise,
the scheme is bound, I should think, to be a
success. With the population of the Republic gradually
increasing&mdash;it could be centupled and there would still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-23" id="Pg_1-23"></a>[<a href="images/1-23.png">23</a>]</span>
be plenty of room for as many people again&mdash;the
S&atilde;o Paulo State will one day supply most of the meat
for the principal markets of Brazil. A good deal of
the cattle which will eventually be raised on the marvellous
campos of Matto Grosso and Goyaz, and destined
to Southern Brazilian markets, will find its way
to the coast via S&atilde;o Paulo. The rest will travel
perhaps via Minas Geraes.</p>

<p>For some years cattle breeding has been carried
on successfully enough, but on a comparatively small
scale, in this State. Experiments have been made in
crossing the best local breeds, principally the Carac&ugrave;,
with good foreign breeds, such as the Jersey, Durham
and Dutch stocks. Pigs of the Berkshire, Yorkshire,
Canasters and Tatus type are the favourites in S&atilde;o
Paulo, and seem to flourish in that climate.</p>

<p>Sheep-breeding is also successful, and would be
even more so if proper care were taken of the animals.
Of the wool-producing kinds, those preferred are the
Leicester, Merino, Oxford and Lincoln, the Oxford
having already produced quite excellent results.</p>

<p>The Government of the State, I understand, is at
present giving great attention to the matter, and is
using discrimination in the selection of suitable breeds
from foreign countries in order to procure the best
animals of various kinds for the production of meat,
butter, and hides. I also believe that an endeavour
is being made to produce in the State a good breed of
horses for military and other purposes.</p>

<p>The elevation of S&atilde;o Paulo city is 2,450 ft. above
the sea level.</p>

<p>The Paulista Railway was interesting, as it was
the first line in Brazil constructed entirely with Brazilian
capital. The line was begun in 1870, but since that
date several extensions have been successfully laid out.
Up to 1909 the lines owned and worked by the Paulista
Railway were the 1&middot;60-metre-gauge trunk line from
Jundiahy to Descalvado (north of S. Paulo), and the
two branch lines of the same gauge from Cordeiro to
Rio Claro; Laranja Azeda to S. Veridiana; the two
branch lines of 0&middot;60 m. gauge from Descalvado to Aurora
and from Porto Ferreira to S. Rita do Passo Quatro.
Then they possessed the one-metre trunk line from
Rio Claro to Araraquara, with the following branch
and extension lines: Visconde de Rio Claro to Jahu;
Araraquara to Jaboticabal; Bebedouro to Barretos;
Mogy Guasso Rinc&atilde;o to Pontal; S. Carlos to S. Euxodia
and Rib. Bonita; Agudos to Dois Corregos and Piratininga;
and the loop line through Brotas. Of the
total charters for 1,114 kil. 261 have been granted by
the Federal Government and are under their supervision,
whereas 583 kil. are under charter granted by
the State of S&atilde;o Paulo.</p>

<p>The following statistics taken from the last Brazilian
Year Book show the wonderful development of the
passenger and goods traffic on the Paulista Railway:&mdash;</p>

<p>At Jundiahy the Paulista Company has extensive
repairing shops for engines. Formerly they had there
also shops for building carriages, but these are now
constructed at the Rio Claro Station, partly from
material which comes from abroad. The rolling stock
of the Company is excellent in every way&mdash;quite up-to-date,
and kept in good condition&mdash;almost too luxurious
for the kind of passengers it has to carry.</p>

<p>It is principally after leaving Campinas that the
scenery of the line is really beautiful&mdash;wonderful undulating
country&mdash;but with no habitations, except,
perhaps, a few miserable sheds miles and miles apart.
At Nueva Odena the Government is experimenting
with Russian and Italian labourers, for whom it has
built a neat little colony. After a time each labourer
becomes the owner of the land he has cultivated. I
am told that the colony is a success.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Coffee&mdash;The Dumont Railway</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My</span> object in travelling by the Paulista Railway was
to inspect the line on my way to the immense coffee
plantations at Martinho Prado, owned by Conselheiro
Antonio Prado. The estate is situated at an elevation
above the sea level of 1,780 ft., upon fertile
red soil. It is difficult, without seeing them, to
realize the extent and beauty of those coffee groves&mdash;miles
and miles of parallel lines of trees of a healthy,
dark green, shining foliage. A full-grown coffee tree,
as everybody knows, varies in height from 6 ft. to 14
or 15 ft. according to the variety, the climate, and
quality of the soil. It possesses a slender stem,
straight and polished, seldom larger than 3 to 5 in.
in diameter, from which shoot out horizontal or slightly
oblique branches&mdash;the larger quite close to the soil&mdash;which
gradually diminish in length to its summit.
The small white blossom of the coffee tree is not unlike
jessamine in shape and also in odour. The fruit,
green in its youth, gradually becomes of a yellowish
tint and then of a bright vermilion when quite ripe&mdash;except
in the Botucat&uacute; kind, which remains yellow to
the end.</p>

<p>The fruit contains within a pericarp a pulp slightly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-27" id="Pg_1-27"></a>[<a href="images/1-27.png">27</a>]</span>
viscous and sweet, within which, covered by a membrane,
are the two hemispherical coffee beans placed
face to face and each covered by a tender pellicle. It
is not unusual to find a single bean in the fruit, which
then takes the shape of an ellipsoid grooved in its longer
axis&mdash;and this is called <i>moka</i> owing to the resemblance
which it bears to the coffee of that name.</p>

<p>The coffee chiefly cultivated in Brazil is the <i>Arabica</i>
L. and to a small extent also the <i>Liberica</i> Hiern, but
other varieties have developed from those, and there
are crosses of local kinds such as the Maragogype, which
takes its name from the place where it was discovered
(Bahia Province). Those varieties are locally known
as Creoulo, Bourbon, Java, Botucat&uacute; (or yellow bean
coffee), the Maragogype, and the Goyaz. The Creoulo,
the Botucat&uacute; and the Maragogype are wilder and show
more resistance than the Java and Bourbon sorts,
which are nevertheless more productive under good
conditions and with careful cultivation, which the first
three qualities do not exact.</p>

<p>The coffee tree is a most serviceable plant, every
part of which can be used. Its wood is much used in
cabinet making, and makes excellent fuel; its leaves,
properly torrefied, and then stewed in boiling water,
give a palatable kind of tea; from the sweet pulp of
its fruit an agreeable liqueur can be distilled; from
its beans can be made the beverage we all know, and
from the shells and residue of the fruit a good fertilizer
can be produced.</p>

<p>The chemical examination of the cinders of the
coffee bean shows that it contains 65&middot;25 per cent of
potash, 12&middot;53 per cent of phosphoric acid, 11&middot;00 per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-28" id="Pg_1-28"></a>[<a href="images/1-28.png">28</a>]</span>
cent of magnesia, 6&middot;12 per cent of lime, and some
traces of sulphuric and salicylic acid, oxide of iron and
chlorine.</p>

<p>An interesting study has been made by Dr. Dafert
of the weight of the various components of the coffee
tree at different ages, from which it appears that the
proportion of potash increases progressively in the
organs as they are more and more distant from the
roots. The contrary is the case with lime and phosphoric
acid, which preponderate generally in the seeds.</p>

<p>With this knowledge a scientific cultivator can
judge exactly how to treat the exigencies of the different
trees at different ages. Naturally, the condition of
the soil has to be taken into consideration in any case.
According to experiments made by Dr. Dafert each
kilo of coffee beans has extracted from the soil&mdash;potash
0&middot;7880 gramme; phosphoric acid 0&middot;4020 gramme;
magnesia 0&middot;3240 gramme; lime 0&middot;1470 gramme.</p>

<p>These experiments apply merely to coffee grown in
Brazil, and are no doubt at variance with experiments
on coffee grown elsewhere. Taking all things into consideration,
it has been proved by chemical analysis that
the Brazilian coffee comes as near as any in its components
to what the normal or perfect coffee should be.</p>

<p>The soil, the elevation of the land, the zone and the
climate naturally have considerable influence on the
quality of the coffee. The <i>Coffea Arabica</i> seems to feel
happy enough in a temperate zone and at elevations
from 1,500 to 2,300 ft. The States of S&atilde;o Paulo,
Minas Geraes, Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo fulfil
most if not all these conditions.</p>

<p>The coffee trees can stand cold&mdash;if not of long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-29" id="Pg_1-29"></a>[<a href="images/1-29.png">29</a>]</span>
duration&mdash;down to freezing-point, as well as a fairly
high temperature. Unlike the Liberia coffee, they
fare better on undulating or broken ground than on
the flat.</p>

<p>Two distinct seasons&mdash;the dry and the rainy&mdash;each
of about six months' duration&mdash;such as are found in
the above-mentioned States of Brazil, seem perfectly
to suit the growth of the coffee trees. The trees are
in bloom for three or four days some time during the
months of September to December. If the rains are
not abundant when the trees are in blossom, and
during the maturing of the fruits, the latter do not
develop properly, especially those at the end of the
branches, where the berries become dry before their
time or even do not form. If the rain comes too long
before the trees are in bloom it causes the blossoms to
open before their time and they are frequently spoiled
by the cold which follows. The coffee beans are collected
in April, during the dry weather.</p>

<p>The coffee trees are very sensitive to winds, cold
or hot, especially when blowing continuously in the
same direction, which causes the undue fall of leaves
and rupture of the bark at the neck of the roots. Wind,
indeed, is one of the most dangerous enemies of coffee
trees, and it is to obviate this danger that in many
countries&mdash;but not in Brazil&mdash;a protecting plantation
in lines of other trees&mdash;generally useful fruit trees&mdash;is
adopted in order to screen the coffee trees from the
prevailing wind, as well as to give a further income
from the fruit produced.</p>

<p>It has been proved that even from good trees below
a certain altitude the coffee is of inferior quality, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-30" id="Pg_1-30"></a>[<a href="images/1-30.png">30</a>]</span>
above that height the crop becomes irregular. In zones
fully exposed to the sun the quality is superior to that
of regions where the sun does not reach or only reaches
for a short portion of the day.</p>

<p>The <i>Coffea Arabica</i> is not particularly exacting in
the quality of the soil, but the soil on which it flourishes
best is that formed in great part by decomposed vegetable
matter&mdash;as, for instance, from ancient trees
mixed with volcanic earth, such as the famous red earth
of the State of S&atilde;o Paulo. Volcanic cinders also are
said to be wonderful fertilizers for the soil, and well
adapted for the welfare of coffee trees.</p>

<p>One thing is undoubted, and that is that the State
of S&atilde;o Paulo possesses the ideal soil for coffee plantations.
Analysis has shown that, curiously enough, the
soil of S&atilde;o Paulo is not in itself very rich. It has an
insufficient quantity of fertilizing substances, particularly
of lime; but it should not be forgotten that
locality and climatic conditions must be taken into
serious consideration, and that we must not be misled
by the difference between the apparent and the real fertility
of the soil. What would be a poor soil in Europe
may prove to be an excellent one in a tropical country.
So the famous "red earth" of S&atilde;o Paulo, which in
a drier climate would be sterile and unproductive, is
there excellent because of its extremely permeable,
porous and powdery qualities.</p>

<p>The special terms used for naming the different
kinds of earth suitable for the cultivation of coffee are:
<i>terra roxa</i> (red earth), <i>massap&eacute;</i>, <i>salmor&atilde;o</i>, <i>catanduva</i>,
<i>terra de areia</i> (sand earth), <i>picarra</i> (stony earth), and
<i>pedreguelho</i> (stony earth).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-31" id="Pg_1-31"></a>[<a href="images/1-31.png">31</a>]</span>
The <i>terra roxa</i> is an argillaceous, ferruginous earth
of diabasic origin, occasionally mixed with sand. It
contains salicylic acid, oxide of iron, alumina, phosphoric
acid, oxide of manganese, lime, magnesia, potash
and soda.</p>

<p>The <i>massap&eacute;</i>, originally decomposed gneiss-granitic
rock mixed with clay, contains oxide of iron. Its
occasional blackness is due to the decomposed vegetable
matter it embodies.</p>

<p>The <i>salmor&atilde;o</i> includes in its formation small stones
indicating the incomplete decomposition of the rock
from which it originates.</p>

<p>The <i>catanduva</i>&mdash;which is of inferior quality&mdash;is composed
of much disintegrated vegetable matter and fine
dust.</p>

<p>The names of the other kinds of earth well denote
their quality.</p>

<p>One reason why coffee cultivation is so popular in
Brazil is because of the general belief that no trouble
is required to look after the trees&mdash;a very mistaken
notion indeed. There is a marked difference between
plantations carefully looked after and those that are
not. More than usual care must be taken to select
the seed for new plantations. The young plants must
get strong in a nursery and then be transplanted into
proper soil, the prudent distance between trees being
generally from 9 to 12 ft. For the convenience of collecting
the beans and keeping the soil clean, a perfect
alignment in all directions is necessary. The most
suitable month for planting coffee in Brazil, according
to the authority of Dr. Dafert, is the month of July.</p>

<p>Great care must be taken of the trees themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-32" id="Pg_1-32"></a>[<a href="images/1-32.png">32</a>]</span>
and of the soil around the trees, which must be kept
clean and absolutely free from grass. The capillary
roots of the trees extending horizontally near the
surface of the soil are much affected by the presence
of any other vegetation, and by the collection of insects
which this produces and harbours. Frost, rain, and the
heat of the sun naturally affect the trees more when
the soil is dirty than when kept clean. Many of the
coffee estates suffer considerably from insufficient labour.
The effects of this are quickly visible on the trees.
Artificial fertilization is useful, even necessary after a
number of years, and so is careful pruning in order to
keep the trees healthy, strong and clean.</p>

<hr />
<p>Coffee trees have many natural enemies&mdash;chiefly
vegetable and animal parasites&mdash;which mostly attack
the leaves. The <i>Ramularia Goeldiana</i>, a parasite not
unlike the <i>Cercospora Coffeicola</i>, is one of the worst,
and undoubtedly the chief offender in Brazil, although
great is the number of insects prejudicial to the trees.
The most terrible of all, perhaps, are the ants and
termites, such as the <i>Termes opacus</i>, which attack
and destroy the roots of young trees. The <i>cupim</i>
(<i>Termes album</i>) or white ant, and the <i>carregador</i> or
<i>Sauba</i>, a giant ant with which we shall get fully acquainted
later on our journey, are implacable enemies
of all plants. Also the <i>quen-quen</i>, another kind of ant.
These ants are so numerous that it is almost an impossibility
to extirpate them. Various ways are suggested
for their destruction, but none are really effective.
Certain larv&aelig;, flies and cochinilla, owing to their
sucking habits, deposit on the leaves and branches a
viscous sugary substance, which, on account of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-33" id="Pg_1-33"></a>[<a href="images/1-33.png">33</a>]</span>
heat, causes fermentation known locally as <i>fumagina</i>.
This produces great damage. Birds pick and destroy
the berries when ripe; and caterpillars are responsible
for the absolute devastation of many coffee districts
in the Rio de Janeiro and S&atilde;o Paulo States. Other
pests of the <i>Heteroptera</i> type attack the roots to such
an extent as to cause the death of the trees.</p>

<p>Among the diseases of the trees are the <i>Aphelencus
Coffe&aelig;</i> and the <i>Loranthus brasiliensis</i>&mdash;the latter a
terrible parasite which quickly envelops the stem and
branches of the tree and ends by killing it.</p>

<p>The collection of the berries is the busiest process
in the fazendas, and has to be performed with considerable
care, for some of the berries are already ripe
and dried when others hidden under the branches have
not yet reached the required degree of maturity. An
experienced hand can collect from 400 to 450 litres
of coffee berries per day. It takes an average of 100
litres of coffee berries to produce 15 kilos of prepared
coffee beans ready to be shipped. The crop is not
the same every year. After one plentiful crop there
generally succeeds one year, sometimes two or three, of
poor&mdash;almost insignificant&mdash;collections, varying according
to the care that is taken of the trees and the soil.</p>

<p>When once the coffee has been collected and transported
to the fazenda in baskets, blankets and sheets,
it is necessary to remove the skin and viscous pulpy
matter which envelop the beans. This is done partly
by maceration in water tanks, and afterwards by drying
upon extensive flat terraces, tiled or cemented, and
locally called <i>terreiro</i>. The process of drying by
machinery has not been adopted in Brazil; principally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-34" id="Pg_1-34"></a>[<a href="images/1-34.png">34</a>]</span>
because of its high cost. The coffee is first placed for
some days in mounds on the terraces, until fermentation
of the outer skin begins, which afterwards hastens
desiccation when coffee is spread flat in a thin layer
on the terraces. When once the coffee berries have
been freed from their pulpy envelope and skin, the
desiccation&mdash;if the weather is propitious&mdash;takes place
in a few days. Care must be taken to move the berries
constantly, so that they dry evenly on all sides, as
perfect desiccation is necessary in order to preserve
the coffee in good condition after it is packed for shipment.</p>

<p>There are two ways of preparing coffee for export&mdash;the
humid and the dry. In the humid process
the berries are placed in a special machine called
<i>despolpadore</i>, which leaves the beans merely covered
and held together in couples by the membrane immediately
enclosing them after the skin and viscous sugary
coating have been removed. Those coffees are called
in commerce, <i>lavados</i>, or washed.</p>

<p>The dry process consists, after the berries have been
skinned and dried, in removing part of the pulp and
membrane in a special machine and a series of ventilators.
They are then quite ready for export.</p>

<p>The preparation of coffee from the drying terraces
is slightly more complicated. The coffee passes through
a first ventilator, which frees it from impurities such
as earth, stems, stones, filaments, etc.; from this it is
conveyed by means of an elevator into the <i>descascador</i>,
where the membrane is removed. Subsequently it
passes through a series of other ventilators, which
eliminate whatever impurities have remained and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-35" id="Pg_1-35"></a>[<a href="images/1-35.png">35</a>]</span>
convey the coffee into a polishing machine (<i>brunidor</i>).
There the coffee is subjected to violent friction, which
not only removes the last atoms of impurity but gives
the beans a finishing polish. The coffee is then ready
for the market.</p>

<p>I spent a most instructive day inspecting the fazenda
of Conselheiro Antonio Prado and having things clearly
explained by his intelligent overseer, Mr. Henrique P.
Ribeiro.</p>

<p>From that place I drove across country, through
endless groves of coffee trees&mdash;for miles and miles&mdash;as
far as the next great coffee estate, belonging to the
Dumont Company, an English concern, with an authorized
capital of &pound;800,000, the estates being valued at
&pound;1,200,000. It is not often one sees an estate so
beautifully managed and looked after in a country
like Brazil. The buildings, the machinery, the "drying
terraces," everything was in capital order. To indicate
on what scale the Company does business, it will be
sufficient to state that in 1911 the coffee crop amounted
to 109,368 cwts., which realized on a gross average
56<i>s.</i> 10&frac12;<i>d.</i> per cwt. This crop was not as plentiful as
in the previous year, when 110,558 cwts. were harvested.
The gross profit for the year up to June 21st,
1911, was &pound;123,811 2<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i>, which, less London charges,
still showed the substantial sum of &pound;119,387 11<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>
There had been a considerable rise in the rate at which
coffee was sold in 1911&mdash;viz., 56<i>s.</i> 10&frac12;<i>d.</i> per cwt. as
compared with 41<i>s.</i> 8&frac12;<i>d.</i> the previous year; but notwithstanding
the high price, the high rate of exchange,
and the cost of laying the coffee down in London&mdash;which
had risen on the estate by 1<i>s.</i> 11&frac12;<i>d.</i> and by 1<i>s.</i> 3&frac12;<i>d.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-36" id="Pg_1-36"></a>[<a href="images/1-36.png">36</a>]</span>
in respect of charges between the estate and London,
the Company had been able to earn a profit of 20<i>s.</i> 4&frac34;<i>d.</i>
per cwt.</p>

<p>I was taken round the estate by Mr. J. A. Davy,
the general manager, whose good and sensible work
was noticeable at every turn. The trees seemed in
excellent condition and likely to have a long life on
the specially suitable rich red soil, and with sufficient
breathing space allowed to maintain them in good
health. The soil was of such unusual richness in that
particular spot that no artificial stimulation was required
in order to keep the trees healthy and vigorous.
One could walk for miles and miles along the beautiful
groves of coffee trees, clean-looking with their rich
deep green foliage.</p>

<p>They seemed to have no great difficulty on the
Dumont estate in obtaining sufficient labour&mdash;greatly,
I think, owing to the fair way in which labourers were
treated. Mr. Davy told me that over an area of 13,261
acres a crop had been maintained which averaged
8&frac14; cwts. per acre.</p>

<p>Experiments have also been made on the Dumont
Estate (at an elevation of 2,100 ft. above the sea level)&mdash;chiefly,
I believe, to satisfy the wish of shareholders in
London&mdash;in the cultivation of rubber, but it did not
prove a success&mdash;as was, after all, to be expected. It
is not easy to make the majority of people understand
that coffee grows lustily in that particular part of the
State of S&atilde;o Paulo mainly because of the eminently
suitable quality of the soil; but it does not at all
follow that soil or climatic conditions which are good
for coffee are suitable for rubber trees, or vice versa.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-37" id="Pg_1-37"></a>[<a href="images/1-37.png">37</a>]</span>
In the case of the Dumont Estates, although the best
possible land was chosen and three different varieties
of rubber&mdash;the Par&aacute;, Cear&aacute; and the Castilloa were
experimented with, it was soon discovered that only
one kind&mdash;the Cear&aacute;&mdash;attained any growth at all, and
this gave very little latex&mdash;owing undoubtedly to the
nature of the soil and the climate. The cost of extracting
the latex was prohibitive. With wages at
four shillings a day a man could collect about one-third
of a pound of latex a day. Rubber trees could,
in that region, not be expected to produce more than
one-fifth of a pound of rubber a year, so that the cost
of collecting and shipping rubber from ten-year-old
trees would amount to 3<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> per lb., without counting
the cost of planting and upkeep.</p>

<p>By a special train on the Dumont Railway line I
travelled across beautiful country&mdash;all coffee plantations&mdash;the
property of the Dumont Company and of
Colonel Schmidt, the "Coffee King," whose magnificent
estate lies along the Dumont Railway line. I
regretted that I could not visit this great estate also,
but I was most anxious to get on with my journey and
get away as soon as possible from civilization. It was
pleasant to see that no rivalry existed between the
various larger estates, and I learnt that the Dumont
Railway actually carried&mdash;for a consideration, naturally&mdash;all
the coffee from the Schmidt Estate to the
Riber&atilde;o Preto station on the Mogyana Railway.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>On the Mogyana Railway</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">I arrived</span> at Riber&atilde;o Preto at 3.45 p.m. on March 29th.
Riber&atilde;o Preto&mdash;421 kil. N.N.W. of S&atilde;o Paulo and 500
kil. from Santos&mdash;is without doubt the most important
commercial centre in the northern part of the State of
S&atilde;o Paulo, and is a handsome active city, neat and
clean-looking, with an Italian, Spanish and Portuguese
population of some 25,000 souls. Its elevation above
the sea level is 1,950 ft. The people of Riber&atilde;o Preto
subsist chiefly on the coffee industry. There are one
or two theatres in the city, the principal being a provincial
one. There are several hotels of various degrees
of cleanliness and several industrial establishments.
Unlike other cities of the interior, Riber&atilde;o Preto boasts
of a good supply of <i>agua potavel</i> (drinking water),
and the town is lighted by the electric light.</p>

<p>The value of land in the vicinity of Riber&atilde;o Preto
varies from 300 milreis to 1,500 milreis for the <i>alqueire</i>,
a price far superior to that of other localities on the
same line, where cultivated land can be purchased at
300 milreis an <i>alqueire</i> and pasture land at 100 milreis.</p>

<p>At Riber&atilde;o Preto I was to leave the Dumont Railway.
Special arrangements had been made for me to
meet at that station a special Administration car which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-39" id="Pg_1-39"></a>[<a href="images/1-39.png">39</a>]</span>
was to be attached to the ordinary express train on
the Mogyana Railway line.</p>

<p>I had been warned at the Dumont Estate that a
brass band had been sent to the Riber&atilde;o Preto station,
where some notabilities were awaiting my arrival in
order to greet me with the usual speeches of welcome.
As I particularly dislike public speaking and publicity,
I managed to mix unseen among the crowd&mdash;they
expecting to see an explorer fully armed and in khaki
clothes of special cut as represented in illustrated
papers. It was with some relief that I saw them departing,
with disappointed faces, and with their brass
instruments, big drums and all, after they had entered
the luxurious special car placed at my disposal by the
Mogyana Railway and found it empty&mdash;I humbly
watching the proceedings some distance away from the
platform.</p>

<p>Thanks to the splendid arrangements which had
been made for me by Dr. Jos&eacute; Pereira Rebon&ccedil;as, the
President of the Mogyana, I was able to take a most
instructive journey on that line, the Traffic Superintendent,
Mr. Vicente Bittencourt, having been instructed
to accompany me and furnish all possible information.</p>

<p>A few words of praise are justly due to the Mogyana
line for the excellence of the service and the perfection
of the rolling stock. I inspected the entire train and
was amazed to find such beautiful and comfortable
carriages, provided with the latest improvements for
passengers of all classes. It is seldom I have seen in
any country a train look so "smart" as the one in
which I travelled from Riber&atilde;o Preto to the terminus
of the line. The appointments of every kind were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-40" id="Pg_1-40"></a>[<a href="images/1-40.png">40</a>]</span>
perfect, the train ran in excellent time, and very
smoothly over well-laid rails. The special car in which
I travelled was "palatial and replete with every comfort,"
if I may use the stock words invariably applied
to railway travelling.</p>

<p>Here are a few interesting points regarding the
Mogyana Railway.</p>

<p>By a provincial law (S&atilde;o Paulo) of March 21st,
1872, a guaranteed interest of 7 per cent on a capital
of 3,000,000 milreis was granted for ninety years
for the construction of a railway of 1 metre gauge
from Campinas to Mogymirim, and of a branch line
to Amparo, to the north-east of Campinas and due east
of Inguary. By a similar law of March 20th, 1875, a
guaranteed interest was granted for thirty years as
to the capital of 2,500,000 milreis for a prolongation
of the line to Casa Blanca.</p>

<p>By a provincial law (Minas Geraes) of October 1st,
1881, another guarantee was granted of 7 per cent for
thirty years, upon a maximum capital of 5,000,000
milreis, for a continuation of the railway through the
provincial territory from the right bank of the Rio
Grande to the left bank of the Paranahyba River.
Finally, by a provincial contract of Minas Geraes of
October, 1884, a further guarantee was granted of
7 per cent for thirty years, on a maximum capital of
5,000,000 milreis, for the construction of the prolongation
of the railway from its terminal point at the
Rio Grande as far as the Paranahyba via the city of
Uberaba.</p>

<p>In view of other important concessions obtained,
one may consider that the Mogyana Company is perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-41" id="Pg_1-41"></a>[<a href="images/1-41.png">41</a>]</span>
the most important railway concern in Brazil, up to
the present time. It does great credit to Brazilians
that the railway was constructed almost entirely by
capital raised on bonds in Brazil itself, the only foreign
loan issued in London being a sum raised amounting
merely to &pound;341,000 at an interest of 5 per cent. Between
the years 1879 and 1886 the Company returned to the
Government of S&atilde;o Paulo the interests received, thus
liquidating its debt. A decree of October 18th, 1890,
fixed the capital spent on the Rio Grande line and
a branch to Caldas at 4,300,000 milreis gold and
1,853,857.750 milreis paper as guarantee of the interest
of 6 per cent conceded by the National Treasury.</p>

<p>In the year 1900 the value of interests received
amounted to 3,190,520.418 milreis in paper, and
1,963,787.300 milreis in gold, out of which 544,787.300
milreis were in debenture bonds. On the same date
the value of interests repaid to the National Treasury
amounted to 1,606,578.581 milreis in paper currency.</p>

<p>The federalized lines of the Company were: from
Riber&atilde;o Preto to Rio Grande (concession of 1883);
from Rio Grande to Araguary (concession of 1890);
with a total extension of 472 kil., and a branch line
from Cascavel to Po&ccedil;o de Caldas, 77 kil., the last 17 kil.
of which were in the Province of Minas Geraes. The
extension from Rio Grande to Araguary, 282 kil., was
also situated in the Province of Minas Geraes.</p>

<p>Having dodged the expectant crowd at the station
unnoticed, I did not go with the Traffic Superintendent,
Mr. Vicente Bittencourt, into the luxurious special car
as the train was steaming out of the Riber&atilde;o Preto
station, but preferred to travel in front of the engine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-42" id="Pg_1-42"></a>[<a href="images/1-42.png">42</a>]</span>
so as to get a full view of the beautiful scenery along
the line. We went at a good speed over gentle curves
rounding hill-sides, the grass of which bent under a
light breeze. Here and there stood a minute white
cottage&mdash;almost toy-like&mdash;where coffee gatherers lived.
On the left we had a grandiose undulating region&mdash;what
the Americans would call "rolling country"&mdash;combed
into thousands of parallel lines of coffee
trees, interrupted at intervals by extensive stretches
of light green grazing land. Only now and then, as
the engine puffed and throbbed under me, did I notice
a rectangle of dried brownish yellow, where the farmers
had grown their Indian corn. These patches were a
great contrast to the interminable mass of rich dark
green of the coffee trees and the light green of the
prairies.</p>

<p>Near these patches&mdash;prominently noticeable in the
landscape because so scarce&mdash;one invariably saw groups
of low whitewashed or red-painted houses, mere humble
sheds. Where the land was not yet under cultivation&mdash;quite
a lot of it&mdash;low scrub and stunted trees far
apart dotted the landscape.</p>

<p>On nearing villages, as the express dashed through,
goats stampeded in all directions: sleepy women and
men looked at the train half dazed as it went by, and
children, with quite a characteristic gesture, screened
their eyes with their elbows to protect them from the
dust and wind the train produced. I was astonished
to notice how many fair-haired children one saw&mdash;curious
indeed in a population of Latin races and negroes.
That golden hair, however, seemed gradually to grow
darker, and became almost black in the older people.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-43" id="Pg_1-43"></a>[<a href="images/1-43.png">43</a>]</span>
Hideous barbed-wire fences gave a certain air of
civilization to those parts, but the landscape was nevertheless
getting desolate as we proceeded farther north.
Except in the immediate vicinity of habitations, one
felt the absolute lack of animal life. Only rarely did
we see a black bird of extraordinary elongated form
dash frightened across the railway line, much too fast
for me to identify to which family it belonged.</p>

<p>One could not help being impressed by the immensity
of the landscape, endless sweeping undulation after
undulation spreading before us, but not a real mountain
in sight. It was like a solid ocean of magnified proportions.
Just above the horizon-line a large accumulation
of globular clouds of immaculate white intensified
the interesting colour-scheme of greens and yellows
on the earth's surface to its full value by contrast.</p>

<p>The large proportion of cultivated land which had
impressed me so much in the vicinity of Riber&atilde;o Preto
gradually diminished; and at sunset, by the time we
had reached <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Butataes'">Batataes</ins>, only 48 kil. farther on, hardly
any more coffee plantations were visible. Only fields
of short grass spread before us on all sides. An occasional
bunch of trees hiding a humble farmhouse could
be perceived here and there, but no other sign of life
upon the immense, silent, green undulations of symmetric
curves, not unlike enormous waves of the sea.</p>

<p>Farther north upon the Mogyana line, land seemed
to diminish in price considerably. Its quality was not
so good, especially for coffee plantations. At Batataes,
for instance, 548 kil. by rail from the coast, prices were
cheaper. Good land for cultivation could be obtained
at 200 milreis, and campos at 25 milreis an alqueire.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-44" id="Pg_1-44"></a>[<a href="images/1-44.png">44</a>]</span>
Such low prices were general north of Riber&atilde;o
Preto, although naturally they were likely to increase
as the country got slowly opened up with new roads
and railroads. Away from the railway the price of
land was much lower.</p>

<p>One thing that particularly struck the traveller
straying in those parts was the poverty of all the minor
towns and villages. The industrial development of the
larger settlements consisted merely of a distillery of
"fire-water" (<i>aguardente</i>), or, if the city were modern
and up-to-date, of a brewery, the only two profitable
industries in those regions.</p>

<p><ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Batateas'">Batataes</ins>&mdash;according to Brazilian statistics&mdash;was
stated to "<i>deve ter</i>"&mdash;"it should have perhaps" some
5,000 inhabitants. The zone around it was said to be
suitable for coffee growing; in fact, the municipality
possessed much machinery for the preparation of coffee.</p>

<p>At 7.50 p.m. punctually&mdash;as she was due&mdash;the
engine steamed into the Franca station, where the train
was to halt for the night. The passenger traffic was
not yet sufficiently extensive on that line to allow trains
to travel continuously during the twenty-four hours.
Passenger trains ran only in the daytime.</p>

<p>I was treated with the greatest consideration while
travelling on the Mogyana. Not only was the Administration
saloon car, containing a comfortable bedroom,
placed at my disposal, but telegrams had been sent all
along the line with orders to supply me with anything
I required. At Franca, much to my surprise, I found
an imposing dinner of sixteen courses waiting for me
in the station hotel&mdash;with repeated apologies that they
were distressed they could not produce more, as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-45" id="Pg_1-45"></a>[<a href="images/1-45.png">45</a>]</span>
telegram announcing my arrival had been received late.
On no account whatever was I allowed&mdash;as I wished&mdash;to
pay for anything. I was rather interested to watch
in the station restaurant the wonderful mixture of
people who had assembled: priests, monks, railway
porters, commercial travellers&mdash;some black, some white,
some a combination of the two&mdash;all sitting together in
a jovial manner sipping coffee or devouring a meal.</p>

<p>The city of Franca itself, 2 kil. away from the
station, 617 kil. from the sea at Santos, 528 kil. from
S&atilde;o Paulo, was in the most remote northerly corner
of the State of S&atilde;o Paulo, and had a population of 9,000
people or thereabout. The electric light had been
installed in the town, and there was a theatre. Much
difficulty was experienced in obtaining sufficient water
for the needs of the population. In the municipality
there existed a number of machines for use in the rice
and the coffee culture, as well as two steam saws, a
butter, and a sugar factory.</p>

<p>There were several trails&mdash;so-called roads&mdash;branching
off from this town and leading to Borda de Matta,
Garimpo das Canoas, Potrocinio do Sapucahy, S. Jos&eacute;
da Bella Vista, etc.</p>

<p>The climate was healthy and delightful. While I
was there the Fahrenheit thermometer registered 76&deg; at
an elevation of 3,450 feet. With a fairly good soil, the
municipality could produce cereals in plenty under
proper cultivation. Land was cheap enough in that
region&mdash;150 milreis per alqueire for good land for cultivation,
and 25 to 30 milreis per alqueire for campos.</p>

<p>We proceeded on our journey north the next
morning, passing through Indaya, 3,450 ft. above the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-46" id="Pg_1-46"></a>[<a href="images/1-46.png">46</a>]</span>
sea level&mdash;a settlement boasting of two houses upon
the highest point of the railway line in the State of
S&atilde;o Paulo. We were nearing the Rio Grande, or Great
River, which, flowing in a westerly direction, formed
in that region the northern boundary of the State of
S&atilde;o Paulo with the State of Minas Geraes. As we got
near the river a greater lack of cultivation was noticeable,
with more extensive zones of wooded country,
especially in the depressions of the land. The undulations
of the landscape were more accentuated as we
approached the Minas Geraes province. Clouds hung
low in the valleys, and we occasionally went through
banks of mist not unlike those of Scotland. At
Chapad&atilde;o the ground was more "<i>accident&eacute;</i>"&mdash;to use
an appropriate French expression&mdash;with deep depressions
and indentations in the surface soil caused by
erosion.</p>

<p>The high land on which we had been travelling between
Franca and Iga&ccedil;aba, the station after Chapad&atilde;o,
gave birth on the west to several important tributaries
of the Rio Grande, enumerated below, from south to
north; the Rio Salgado, the Rio do Carmo, Riber&atilde;o
Ponte Nova, Rib. Bandeira, Rio da Soledade, Rib.
S. Pedro; on the east was the Rib. S. Jesus, also a
tributary of the Rio Grande.</p>

<p>As the train sped down the incline towards the Rio
Grande we were now treated to magnificent scenery on
our right. An isolated hill stood at the bottom of
the valley with higher mountains on either side of it,
and, beyond, a high flat-topped plateau. The railway
line skirted snake-like along the hill-side. The hill-tops
were getting more rounded and fairly thickly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-47" id="Pg_1-47"></a>[<a href="images/1-47.png">47</a>]</span>
wooded. As we got to a lower elevation the isolated
hill assumed the appearance of an elephant's back. A
grassy valley several miles wide opened up before us.</p>

<p>At Rifaina Station we had reached the level of the
banks of the Rio Grande, that is to say, 1,950 ft. above
the sea level. The valley of the river was formed, in
this case also, by erosion which had left isolated hills
in terraces, one with as many as six distinct terraces,
others with rounded backs, but all plainly showing in
their stratification, which was identical with that of
the surrounding elevations, that in former days there
stood, where the valley was now, a plateau which had
subsequently been gradually eroded by the action of
water and wind.</p>

<p>Having crossed the river, we arrived at Jaguara&mdash;we
were now travelling in the Minas Geraes Province&mdash;where
a breakfast awaited us of rice, pork, dried
beef, as hard as leather, omelette with shrimps (a much
cherished dish in those parts), beans, mandioca, and
coffee. Black railway porters, firemen and engine
drivers all sat round the table and ate heartily, the
meal costing 2 milreis, or about 2<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The railway ran almost parallel with the river on
the north side round the immense curve which the Rio
Grande describes in that particular section. We passed
Sacramento (elev. 1,850 ft.), and, in numerous curves,
the railway rose by a gradient of 3&frac12; per cent among
hills seemingly worn out by torrential rains into
rounded shapes with huge gaps between. We left the
Rio Grande, there about 100 yards wide with thickly
wooded banks and islands. At Conquista we had
already again reached an elevation of 2,350 ft., but we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-48" id="Pg_1-48"></a>[<a href="images/1-48.png">48</a>]</span>
still continued to rise by a gradient of 2&frac12; to 3 per cent,
until a pass was reached from which two exquisite
panoramas were obtained. One, particularly interesting,
looked over Conquista with its whitewashed houses&mdash;some
250 of them&mdash;and red-tiled roofs against the
background formed by the rugged sides of the natural
cauldron worn in the tableland by erosion.</p>

<p>At 538 kil., 2,700 ft. above the sea level, a view was
obtained of a small coffee plantation, but most of the
country around was scantily wooded, grassy in places,
barren in others.</p>

<p>The railway, having descended to 2,500 ft., rose
again to 2,900 ft. near Paneiras Station. Then, through
beautiful grazing country, gently undulating, we descended
and mounted and went round sweeping curves,
which formed in places regular loops not unlike a
horseshoe. Two pits producing a considerable quantity
of lime existed some 2 kil. from Paneiras. Weak
attempts were noticeable here and there at growing
coffee. We were now in an eminently wonderful
pasture land&mdash;getting more and more beautiful as we
neared Uberaba, where we found ourselves on almost
flat country at an elevation of 2,900 ft., with hardly
any trees at all and with a delicious climate. The town
of Uberaba, with some 12,000 people, was situated at
a slightly lower elevation&mdash;only 2,700 ft.</p>

<p>Uberaba was perhaps the most important distributing
centre in the western part of Minas Geraes, for
many trails branched from that place to various distant
points in the farther interior. The most important
trail was the one to Sta. Rita do Paranahyba, thence
to the capital of Goyaz Province via Marrinhos and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-49" id="Pg_1-49"></a>[<a href="images/1-49.png">49</a>]</span>
Allem&atilde;o; whence a second trail went to Fructal via
Concei&ccedil;ao das Alagaos; a third, to Sant' Anna do
Paranahyba, going on the whole almost due west,
but with great deviations, went almost across South
America as far as Pulacayo, in Bolivia, crossing first the
State of Matto Grosso in its southern and narrower
point via Coxim and Corumba, then all Bolivia, eventually
joining the La Paz-Antofagasta Railway line at
Uyum (Pulacayo is connected by rail to Uyum), and
ending at the Pacific Ocean. Another trail led to
Monte Alegre; yet another to Uberabinha&mdash;although
the railway had already connected that town with
Uberaba. This last trail continued, making great
detours, to Bagagem, then to Patrocino, from which
place it deviated due north to Paracat&uacute;, where three
ramifications occurred: one to Sta. Lucia, Pyrinopolis,
and Goyaz (capital); the second to Jamarria, Jocar&eacute;
(on the San Francisco River), and Carrinhan (on the
Carinhaha River, a tributary of the San Francisco),
and eventually by water to the Atlantic Ocean; the
third trail proceeded due east&mdash;across the S. Francisco
River to Montes Claros and Gr&atilde;o Mogol; a fourth in
a south-easterly direction led to Curvelho and Sta.
Lucia, where it met the railway to Rio de Janeiro.
Another route proceeded south to Sta. Rita do Paraiso.</p>

<p>The price of land&mdash;which was excellent in the valley
of the river&mdash;in the vicinity of Uberaba was from 30
to 150 milreis per alqueire&mdash;each alqueire being
reckoned at 10,000 square bra&ccedil;as, and a bra&ccedil;a being
about 6&frac12; ft., or a little over two metres.</p>

<p>After leaving Uberaba the scenery was magnificent,
especially when a storm approached as we were steam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-50" id="Pg_1-50"></a>[<a href="images/1-50.png">50</a>]</span>ing
over the Serra de Caracol. Dense black clouds
collected and capped the dark green forest of the
Serra, while down, down below on our right the endless
gently undulating plain of fresh green grass was brilliantly
illuminated by a warm dazzling sun. Most
beautiful grazing land&mdash;practically going to waste
now&mdash;we crossed on reaching the highest point of the
Serra; grass, grass, as far as the eye could see&mdash;quite
flat land&mdash;but not a head of cattle in sight; in fact,
no sign of animal life, and a stillness of death except
for the puffing of the railway engine on which I sat.
Water, however, did not seem to abound&mdash;only a small
stream, near which curious-looking patches, or <i>bosquets</i>
of trees lay in dark spots on that light green expanse.
We were then at an elevation of 3,400 ft., amid delightfully
cool and crisp air.</p>

<p>At Burity passed the great route of the cattle
dealers from Goyaz and Matto Grosso for Sta. Rita,
Passos, and Tres Cora&ccedil;&otilde;es do Rio Verde. At Palestina
(845 kil. from the sea) we were on what seemed an
interminable flat plateau with ideally green grass,
and here and there patches of stunted vegetation. Land
could be purchased there as low as 10 milreis an alqueire,
although the best land cost from 50 to 300 milreis.</p>

<p>All was absolutely flat until we reached Sicupira
(elev. 3,100 ft. above the sea level), where we began
to descend to the Rio Uberabinha, its delightfully clear
crystalline water winding its way through scrub.</p>

<p>At Uberabinha we again came across the wonderful
red earth of the Riber&atilde;o Preto district. Situated at
an elevation of 3,050 ft. stood the little town of some
4,000 inhabitants, about 500 yards from the comfort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-51" id="Pg_1-51"></a>[<a href="images/1-51.png">51</a>]</span>able
and pretty station. Although the land was beautiful,
cultivation could not be said to be prevalent.
Merely some rice, beans, and Indian corn were grown
in small quantities.</p>

<p>From Uberabinha the railway line descended all
the time through thinly wooded country of shrubs and
stunted trees; the verdant prairies, so refreshing to
the eyes, were left behind, and the country became more
broken, but the land was still excellent for agricultural
purposes. After crossing a well-constructed iron bridge
resting on two masonry pillars and spanning the picturesque
rapids of the Rio das Velhas&mdash;the river, with
its turbid, muddy, nasty-looking water, being there
some 80 yards wide, at an elevation of 2,050 ft. above
the sea level&mdash;we again began a steep ascent by a
gradient of over 3 per cent, following most of the time
the river course. The thickly wooded banks obstructed
a good deal of the view except here and there, where a
charming glimpse of the water could be obtained.</p>

<p>Seven hundred and eighty-nine kilometres from
Campinas&mdash;or 982 kil. from the Atlantic Ocean at
Santos&mdash;we arrived at the terminal station of the
Mogyana Railway at a place called Araguary, 3,150 ft.
above the sea level&mdash;one of the dirtiest and most unpleasant
spots on the face of the earth. The termini
of railway lines in newly developed countries seem
to act like filters. Whatever is good passes through;
only the impurities or dregs remain.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Terminus of the Railway&mdash;An Unpleasant Incident&mdash;The Purchase
of Animals&mdash;On the March with the Caravan</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">A great</span> crowd had assembled at the station. The
train had hardly stopped when my car was invaded
by boisterous people, who embraced me and patted me
on the back in the most approved Brazilian style.
Before I could inquire who they were, one fellow,
more boisterous than the others, informed me that he
had purchased a great many mules for me, that he had
engaged men for me, and also procured riding and pack-saddles,
harness, implements, clothing and bedding for
the men he had engaged, and I do not know what else.
Everything was paid for. I could return the sum paid
out the next day. Another man said he had already
prepared a sumptuous apartment for me in the best
hotel in the town.</p>

<p>When asked who had instructed them to make
such arrangements, they were vague, and on being
pressed for an answer gave names of people of whose
existence I was perfectly ignorant. Before I could
realize what all this meant I discovered&mdash;much to my
annoyance&mdash;that all my baggage had been taken out
of the train and had been conveyed to the hotel. I was
therefore compelled to proceed there myself, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-53" id="Pg_1-53"></a>[<a href="images/1-53.png">53</a>]</span>
company of my new "friends," who shouted everything
they had to say at the top of their voices, so
that I should not fail to understand. It was already
night, and the streets of the town were in such a
terrible condition that the overladen carriage&mdash;there
were people on all the seats, on the box and standing
on the steps&mdash;nearly turned over on going round
corners. The wheels sank up to their axles in mud.</p>

<p>We pulled up at the hotel door, where another crowd
of loafers had assembled. I was literally dragged into
the hotel&mdash;for I had become somewhat reluctant, first
on seeing the appearance of the place, then on being
met by waves of a nauseating odour which suggested
the non-existence of sanitary arrangements and worse.</p>

<p>"Come in, come in!... wait here!" shouted
they in a most excited manner, when I expressed a
wish to inspect the palatial quarters which they had
been good enough to reserve for me.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment!" shouted the landlord, a
slumbering, disjointed, murderous-looking creature,
whose violent gestures and waving of hands in front
of my face were somewhat irritating. He dashed
into a room on the ground floor&mdash;and we outside could
hear an altercation between the loud-voiced proprietor
and the plaintive moans of a half-dying man.</p>

<p>A moment later the half-dying man, skeleton-like,
with livid eyes, a complexion the colour of a lemon
gone bad, and quivering bare legs, was literally dragged
out of the bed and roughly thrown out of the door.</p>

<p>"Here is your room!" cried the landlord triumphantly
to me, as he flung out of that apartment some
cheap canvas bags, clothes&mdash;which from birth had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-54" id="Pg_1-54"></a>[<a href="images/1-54.png">54</a>]</span>
been innocent of washing and pressing&mdash;and the socks,
shoes, and day shirt of the guest who had been ejected.</p>

<p>The odour alone, as I peeped into the room, was
enough to stifle any one with the sense of scent even
less delicate than my own. As for the vacant bed&mdash;any
pariah dog of any other country would have been
offended to be offered such filthy accommodation.</p>

<p>In Brazil&mdash;as elsewhere&mdash;it does not do to lose
one's calm. I also wished to avoid an unpleasant
quarrel, as I have a belief that quarrels are bad for
one's health. I spoke gently and kindly to the hotel-keeper,
and said that, although I had ordered nothing,
still, as he had kindly reserved that charming apartment
for me, I should be very pleased to pay for it,
which I would do at once. If he would excuse me, I
preferred to go back to sleep in my private car. Upon
hearing these words a nasty tragi-comic scene occurred,
which, had I not remained cool and collected, might
have ended badly.</p>

<p>"Do you know, sir," shouted the landlord, with
livid features and eyes shooting out of their orbits, so
enraged was he&mdash;"do you know that I am the Chief
of Police here, and that everybody is afraid of me? I
have only to give orders and every one will kill any one
I like." Here he discontinued shaking his somewhat
grimy hands under my nose and, drawing himself up,
stood upon the doorstep of the hotel in order to harangue
the great crowd which had collected.</p>

<p>"We are all millionaires in Brazil," shouted the
landlord, with an effort which seriously impaired the
safety of his fully-congested jugular vein. "We are
all atheists and anarchists in Brazil. Down with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-55" id="Pg_1-55"></a>[<a href="images/1-55.png">55</a>]</span>
infamous oppression and slavery of Europe! Down
with kings and emperors! Down with Europe, the
land of oppression and cruelty!" And again: "We
in Brazil are the richest people on earth. We are
all millionaires in Brazil. We do not need foreign
charity!"</p>

<p>"Down with foreigners!" answered the chorus of
assembled natives.</p>

<p>The railway inspector who had been sent by the
Company to accompany me became scared at the
turn matters were taking, and told me, against the
instructions he had received, that I could not now
return to the car. Upon hearing this, my new friends,
believing they had me in their power, renewed their
vocal attack.</p>

<p>I remained some time endeavouring to collect my
baggage, pretending to pay no attention whatever to
the absurd oratory. To this day I cannot yet grasp
what the oppression of Europe had to do with my
wanting to pay for something I had never had. I
then repeated my offer, which was again refused.
With the protection of his strong rear-guard, the Chief
of Police advanced bravely towards me, holding in a
suggestive manner with his right hand the pommel of
his revolver in the back pocket of his trousers. In a
tragic manner he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"We will settle this matter, to-morrow."</p>

<p>"We will settle it at once," I placidly replied.</p>

<p>"No, to-morrow," he repeated, with a vicious look.</p>

<p>"Very good: at what time and where?"</p>

<p>"At ten o'clock," he eventually grunted, after I had
repeated the above question four times.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-56" id="Pg_1-56"></a>[<a href="images/1-56.png">56</a>]</span>
I also politely invited all the others present to come
forward if they had any claims to square. I was quite
ready to settle anybody at any time and anywhere.
Perhaps they might get more than they wished.</p>

<p>I departed with my baggage laden on two carriages
and a cart, and eventually found accommodation at
an equally filthy hotel near the station&mdash;only the latter
place was kept by a humble and honest, decrepit old
woman. I do not know that I have ever spent a more
miserable evening anywhere. I do not mind roughing
it in the roughest way possible, but I have always
detested pretentious efforts at civilization of an inferior
kind. Thus I sat having a meal&mdash;eggs, beans, rice&mdash;all
soaked in <i>toucinho</i> (pork fat) which I detest and
loathe. I watched black railway workmen and
porters stuffing themselves with food in a most unappetizing
way, and making disgusting noises of all
kinds.</p>

<p>Fortunately I remembered that a friend of mine&mdash;a
railway contractor, Mr. Louis Schnoor&mdash;must be at
that time in Araguary, looking after the construction
of the new railway line which will eventually join
Araguary to the capital of Goyaz. I went in search of
him, stumbling along the terrible roads with deep
holes and pools of water and mud. As luck would have
it, I was able to purchase from him, that very same
evening, a number of excellent mules, which he very
generously had offered to place at my disposal without
payment. Also he promised to supply me with two
reliable men&mdash;a job not at all easy in that particular
part of Brazil.</p>

<p>Mr. Louis Schnoor&mdash;a Brazilian of German extrac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-57" id="Pg_1-57"></a>[<a href="images/1-57.png">57</a>]</span>tion&mdash;was
a godsend to me. Thanks to him, I returned
that night quite happy to the miserable hotel. Happy,
because in less than half an hour I had arranged to
leave that pestilential hole the following day. Mr.
Schnoor had kindly undertaken that he would send
me, at eleven o'clock the next morning, in a special
train to the end of the line in construction, some 45 kil.
farther north. In a town of gentle folks like Araguary
the luxury of sleeping with one's window open could
not be indulged in&mdash;especially as nearly all the houses
were one storey high. So the night was rendered
particularly oppressive and long, tormented as you were
in your bed by its innumerable inhabitants, which
stung you all over. I had taken the precaution to
spread a waterproof sheet under my own blankets on
the bed, but that, too, proved ineffective. Mosquitoes
were numerous.</p>

<p>No sanitary arrangements to speak of existed in
Araguary, so that everything was flung out of the
windows into the streets, which made walking about
the town most objectionable. The odour everywhere
was revolting, as can well be imagined. The city
was nevertheless considered by the natives as all that
is most perfect in the way of civilization, for not only
did it possess a few an&aelig;mic electric lights&mdash;so far apart
as to be a nuisance instead of a help in seeing one's
way about&mdash;but also, behold! it actually boasted of
a spasmodic cinematograph. There were some 500
houses, all counted, at Araguary, all more or less
miserable-looking, and a population of some 2,500 souls&mdash;"lost
souls," I should think.</p>

<p>Slowly, very slowly came the next morning, March<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-58" id="Pg_1-58"></a>[<a href="images/1-58.png">58</a>]</span>
31st. At ten o'clock sharp I called on the Chief of
Police at his hotel, and found that he had departed
early in the morning and was not to be expected back
for some hours! A charming way of keeping an
appointment which he was so anxious to bring about.</p>

<p>In the company of Mr. Louis <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Schoor'">Schnoor</ins> I also called
on the persons who said they had made arrangements
for my expedition, as I did not wish to have any misunderstanding
in the matter. Far from having purchased
mules, horses, saddles and harness, they could
produce nothing on demand, and finally asked me to
remain in Araguary for one month&mdash;fancy one month
in Araguary!&mdash;so that they could produce their
purchases.</p>

<p>As I was driving in Mr. Schnoor's carriage we met,
a long way from his home and hotel, the Chief of
Police and hotel proprietor. I immediately dismounted
and informed that gentleman of my visit at the appointed
time. I also demanded that whatever he
wished me to settle must be settled at once.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all," said he, shaking me warmly by
the hand. "You owe me nothing. It was all a mistake.
It was all a mistake. Please do not think of
it any more. You owe me nothing, nothing, nothing.
If I can be of use to you, pray order me! I am your
humble servant." And his delightful politeness was
such that I could hardly realize it was the same vicious
man of the previous evening. In my surprise I had
to turn to Mr. Schnoor to inquire whether I had got
hold of the wrong man.</p>

<p>Yes, indeed. Some of those fellows of Central
Brazil were a remarkable mixture of villainy and charm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-59" id="Pg_1-59"></a>[<a href="images/1-59.png">59</a>]</span>&mdash;in
chemical language one might describe them as
sublimates of rascality and delightful manners.</p>

<p>However, good manners or not, I had taken such
a dislike to the place that I was glad when eleven
o'clock came and Mr. Schnoor conveyed me to the
special train&mdash;an engine and one car. I inspected the
new station of the Goyaz railway, which was already
finished&mdash;a useful, well-constructed building, quite sufficient
for its needs. In the company of Mr. Schnoor,
his chief engineer, Mr. Schirmer and Mr. Bertoux, we
left Araguary&mdash;oh, what a relief!&mdash;for the end of the
line, 45 kil. away. I had decided to go and wait there
in the open country the few hours which would be
necessary to collect the men who were to accompany
me, and the mules.</p>

<p>The work on that portion of the Goyaz line which
was already laid was well and quickly done. Mr.
Schnoor assured me that in four or five months more
they expected to run trains to Catal&atilde;o. An iron
bridge will eventually be built across the Paranahyba
River, within a short distance of which the line had
already been laid when I was there. Some delay had
been experienced in making a deep cut on the south
side of Paranahyba Hills, where the strata had been
found much harder than expected.</p>

<p>I camped for a day and a half at Morro da Meza,
a lovely spot at an elevation of 2,850 ft., from whence
an immense panorama could be enjoyed. What a
relief this heavenly place was after Araguary, and how
everlastingly grateful I shall be to my friend Mr.
Schnoor for having deposited me there!</p>

<p>I took the opportunity of the solitude to rearrange<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-60" id="Pg_1-60"></a>[<a href="images/1-60.png">60</a>]</span>
my baggage. On April 1st my good friend Schnoor
reappeared to see that all arrangements were satisfactory
for my departure.</p>

<p>Morro da Meza will ever remain present in my mind,
for it was my jumping-off place into the wilds. It was
from there that the actual marching on horseback
and on foot began, and it was there I last saw a railway
train for the best part of a year.</p>

<p>On April 1st, at 4 p.m., I left Morro da Meza, went
through the new railway cut in preparation, crossed
the Paranahyba River (at an elevation of 1,970 ft.
above the sea level), and made my camp on the opposite
side of the stream at Anh&atilde;nguera (elev. 2,100 ft.
above sea level) in the railway engineers' camp, 800
yards away from the water. The engineers, an Italian,
Mr. Schnoor's father-in-law, and a Russian&mdash;a Mr.
Martens&mdash;showed me every possible civility. A curious
incident occurred while we were having dinner. The
day was a holiday, and the workmen on the line were
resting. We were sipping our coffee, when a man
entered our hut and said a companion of his had been
shot. We rushed to see him, and we found that the
poor wretch had had his skin perforated in eight
different places by the same bullet. What was more
remarkable was that each perforation was close to
dangerous places in the man's anatomy, and yet not
a single wound was mortal. This is how it happened.
The man was lying down in his suspended hammock,
resting his left hand on his left knee. A friend came
along to show him a new automatic pistol he had
purchased. In the usual silly fashion he had pointed
it at his friend. The pistol went off, and the bullet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-61" id="Pg_1-61"></a>[<a href="images/1-61.png">61</a>]</span>
passed just under the skin at the knee, at the side of
the knee-cap, and having come out again, went right
through the soft part of the hand between the thumb
and index finger. It then perforated the arm at the
biceps, and further entering the chest, shaved the
heart and came out at the shoulder-blade, continuing
its flight beyond to somewhere where no one could
find it again. That spoke highly for the penetrating
power of bullets from automatic pistols, and also for the
little harm those little bullets may inflict. The man, after
we had carefully dressed his wounds, looked, perhaps,
a little miserable, but he was able to depart on horseback
carrying with his good arm a bottle of medicine.</p>

<p>The Goyaz railway was making rapid progress.
The rails were soon to be laid on the north side of the
river as far as Catal&atilde;o. The bed of the railway was
fast being made ready.</p>

<p>It was not until April 3rd that I was able actually
to make a start with my caravan. My good friend,
Mr. Louis Schnoor, had promised me two men&mdash;Alcides
Ferreiro dos Santos and Filippe da Costa de
Britto; the first a German Brazilian of a violent revolutionary
temper but of extraordinary bravery; the
other a pure negro of a boisterous, simple nature, also
of indisputable bravery in moments of great danger.
These two men&mdash;both natives of Araguary&mdash;proved
themselves to be on that fateful expedition the two
best men I possessed. Thus, if nothing else can be
said in praise of Araguary, it must be said in justice
that it can produce some men of great courage and
faithfulness&mdash;a boast which cannot well be applied to
many places in Brazil.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-62" id="Pg_1-62"></a>[<a href="images/1-62.png">62</a>]</span>
On April 3rd, at 9 a.m., after a touching farewell,
I left the engineers' camp mounted on a magnificent
mule that Mr. Schnoor had insisted on lending me as
far as Goyaz, with the pack animals which I had
purchased. I did not follow the principal road, which
went by a somewhat circuitous route from Araguary
to the capital of Goyaz via the towns of Catal&atilde;o and
Bomfin, but preferred to travel across country by a
short cut which took you there in an almost direct
line in a north-westerly direction. On getting over
the Serrinha (elev. 2,250 ft.), a hill range, one obtained
a gorgeous view of the valley of the Paranahyba River&mdash;a
river which, already of good width there, became
eventually the great Parana. It is on the right bank
of the river, near its mouth, some thousands of miles
from where we were, that Buenos Aires is situated.</p>

<p>Going through a beautiful forest in undulating
country, we reached the summit of a flat-topped tableland,
2,500 ft. above the sea level, with a gentle slope
towards the north, where the edge of its summit was
some 50 ft. lower than on the south. The vegetation
was somewhat stunted, but interesting, for many were
the trees I noticed which could be put to some use
or other. The Barbatim&atilde;o (<i>Stryphnodendron bar.</i> M.)
was plentiful, and could be used advantageously in
tanning leather; the Pao ferro (<i>C&aelig;salpinia ferria</i> M.)
and the Paneira, were present in quantities.</p>

<p>Through the forest we descended in three hours to
the Rio Virissimo, which, swollen by the sub-tributaries
Barrocas, Indaica, Pirahitinga and Perobas on the
east and Vae Vem on the west, throws itself into the
Paranatinga between Morro Alto and Porto do Barreiro.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-63" id="Pg_1-63"></a>[<a href="images/1-63.png">63</a>]</span>
That stream had been bridged over. We had descended
to 2,000 ft. During the entire distance&mdash;we had
travelled some 23 kil. from the Paranahyba River&mdash;we
had passed only two miserable sheds and we had not
met a single soul, barring a glimpse at a shaggy female
who happened to be opening the door of her hut as we
were passing, and with a yell of terror banged it again,
and bolted it as she perceived us riding by.</p>

<p>A peculiar kind of wild fig-tree was to be seen, ball-like
in appearance, with branches inclined down instead
of skyward like most trees. On our right as we
proceeded down to the farms of S. Jeronymo and Sta.
Barbara (elev. 2,400 ft.) stood a mountain with
beautiful grazing land upon its slopes. Healthy fat
cattle, in most wonderful condition&mdash;testifying to the
excellence of the grazing in that region&mdash;were bred by
the farmers. To the north, north-east and north-west
behind this place were to be seen delightful green
round-topped hills, also with excellent grazing. A
few cows and imported zebus were to be seen, it is
true, but the country could support a million times that
number and more.</p>

<p>It was that evening that I noticed for the first time
in Brazil a peculiar and most wonderful effect of light
at sunset&mdash;not unlike an aurora borealis. White,
well-defined radiations shot skyward from the west,
where the sun had set, and stood out luminously against
the dark blue sky, like the spokes of a gigantic wheel.
This effect, as we shall see, was repeated frequently at
sunset, and sometimes was even more beautiful than
on the occasion of that first acquaintance with it.</p>

<p>We marched 39&frac12; kil. that day&mdash;with my nine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-64" id="Pg_1-64"></a>[<a href="images/1-64.png">64</a>]</span>
pack-mules, Formosa (which in Portuguese means
"beautiful"), the splendid white mule I rode, and
three other mules ridden by my men. It was a real
pleasure to see the appetite of the animals when we
made camp. How joyfully they ground with their
powerful jaws the Indian corn which each had received
in a nose-bag soon after we had halted, removed the
loads and saddles from their backs, and properly
groomed them!</p>

<p>When we started the next morning we went through
most beautiful grazing land for some 20 kil., and
through marvellous grassy slopes on the mountains
beyond. Streamlets of clear abundant water were
passed. From 2,050 ft., the elevation of the stream,
we rose to 2,650 ft., then descended gradually to the
village of Corumbahyba, with its brand-new red-tiled
roofs and whitewashed houses&mdash;very tiny, and, with
one exception, all one-storied. The windows and
doors were gaily decorated with bright blue paint.
There was a church, of course, on one side of the large
square smothered in high grass, and by the church two
wooden pillars supported a beam from which hung a
bronze bell. Then in the centre of the square stood,
most prominent of all in the village, a huge wooden
cross in a dilapidated condition. What little life
seemed to exist in the place was to be found in the
local store, where an inquisitive crowd had collected
when I arrived.</p>

<hr />
<p>My mules were let loose to graze in the square,
joining a number of cows that were there already. As I
sat in the shop, closely examined by the inhabitants,
I returned the compliment by analysing them. What a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-65" id="Pg_1-65"></a>[<a href="images/1-65.png">65</a>]</span>
strange, dried-up, worn-out appearance young and
old presented! What narrow, chicken-like chests,
what long, unstable legs and short arms. And, dear
me! what shaggy, rebellious hair, which stood out
bristle-like in all directions upon their scalps! Yet
those people came from ancestors who must have been,
centuries ago, magnificent types of humanity to be
able to accomplish what they did in the way of colonization.
With the habit we possess of looking for finer,
healthier specimens of humanity in the country than in
the cities, this condition of affairs came somewhat as
a surprise to me, since that rule generally applied to
most nations I have visited except Brazil. Those
people, partly by constant intermarriage among themselves,
partly by the mixture of black blood with the
white, and greatly owing to the effects of the most
terrible complaint of the blood in existence&mdash;universal
in Brazil&mdash;partly, too, by the dull, uninteresting,
wasted lives they led and the poverty of their nourishment,
were reduced to a state of semi-idiocy. The
men hardly seemed to have the strength and energy
to walk or even stand up&mdash;although I must confess, to
my regret, that they had not yet lost the power of
talking.</p>

<p>Their features were unattractive. Eyes wide apart
and widely expanded, so that the entire circle of the
iris was exposed, although the eyeball itself was not
<i>&agrave; fleur de t&ecirc;te</i>, but rather sunk into excessively spacious
orbital cavities in the skull. The part of the eyeball
which is usually white was yellow with them, softened
somewhat by luxuriant eyelashes of abnormal length.
In fact, the only thing that seemed plentiful and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-66" id="Pg_1-66"></a>[<a href="images/1-66.png">66</a>]</span>
vigorous with them was the hair, which grew abundantly
and luxuriantly everywhere, just as bad grass
and weeds do on uncultivated or abandoned lands.
There was a lot of hair everywhere&mdash;on the scalp, on
the eyebrows, on the men's unshaven cheeks, on the
chest, the arms, hands, and the legs. It is, I believe,
a well-known fact that hair is generally more luxuriant,
the weaker and more an&aelig;mic the subject is&mdash;up to a
certain point.</p>

<p>Deep grooves and hollow cheeks&mdash;the latter due
to absence of teeth&mdash;marked the faces of even young
men. Then one of the most noticeable peculiarities
was the extraordinary development, prominence and
angularity of the apple of the throat. The ears&mdash;which
to my mind show the real character and condition of
health of a person more than any other visible part of
his or her anatomy&mdash;were large and prominent, occasionally
well-formed, but lacking colour and the
delightful, well-chiselled, vigorous curves of healthy,
normal, intelligent people. The hands and feet were
generally small and well-shaped, in wonderful condition&mdash;though
not necessarily clean&mdash;owing to the
inborn reluctance which all the people of Brazil have
towards manual labour.</p>

<p>It has always been my experience that, generally
speaking, malformed people possess distorted brains&mdash;which
does not mean at all that the brain of a malformed
person may not perhaps develop in a marvellous
manner in one particular direction. What I maintain
is that, with few possible exceptions, the brains of
malformed people are seldom perfectly balanced. In
those particular subjects it did not take a deep student<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-67" id="Pg_1-67"></a>[<a href="images/1-67.png">67</a>]</span>
of human nature to set down the entire crowd of them
as visionaries, most fantastically inclined&mdash;in which
direction, having no restraint whatever, they ran
absolutely amuck.</p>

<p>Yet there was something very charming about the
people of the interior of Brazil, after they had overcome
their first suspicion of strangers and their own shyness.
They seemed imbued with the idea that everybody
went there specially to do them harm. They lived in
a constant state of fear and trembling, even of their
own relations and friends. They all went about armed
to the teeth, and would not dream of going a yard
outside their homes without a revolver, a rifle and a
dagger. Even to walk about the village the men were
all armed.</p>

<p>When not in a rage or sulky&mdash;which seemed to be
their almost constant condition&mdash;they were the most
good-hearted people I have ever met; gentle, affectionate&mdash;in
fact, so sentimental that it became a positive
nuisance. If one learnt how to deal with them&mdash;which
was not always easy&mdash;they were really delightful people
in their enviable simplicity.</p>

<p>A reflection of the people's mentality was to be
discovered at a glance in examining the articles that
were for sale in the only shop in the village. There,
remember, you were in a country which, from an
agricultural point of view, could be made of immense
value. Now, did you notice any implements in the
shop which suggested agricultural pursuits of any kind
whatever? No; what you found were patent leather
dress shoes, elaborately embroidered top-boots, fancy
neckties, gaudy gilt and silver spurs of immense size,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-68" id="Pg_1-68"></a>[<a href="images/1-68.png">68</a>]</span>
bottles of powerful perfumes, fancy soaps, mirrors,
combs, and highly-coloured calicoes, beer, fire-water,
and other such articles of luxury.</p>

<hr />
<p>The Corumbahyba village stood at an elevation of
2,250 ft. in a hollow surrounded by low hills. The
water was delicious at that place.</p>

<p>As I was getting through my lunch&mdash;which I enjoyed
thoroughly after my morning march of 23 kil.&mdash;I
saw crossing the square two murderers laden with
iron chains, led along with a rope by two mounted men.
The natives present laughed as they saw the poor devils
struggle along. Not a sign of pity or care was shown
by anybody present.</p>

<p>After leaving Corumbahyba we witnessed a panorama
of magnificent mountain scenery from a height
of 2,550 ft., to which we had ascended. Then came a
steep and rugged descent through a forest down to
a streamlet (2,250 ft.); then up another ascent to
2,350 ft. and down again to 2,050 ft. at the great
Corumb&aacute; River, there 300 yards wide. We crossed this
beautiful stream&mdash;animals and all&mdash;on three canoes
joined together, upon which a platform had been
built.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Travelling across Country&mdash;A Musical Genius&mdash;Valuable Woods&mdash;Thermal
Springs</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the river were several picturesque two-wheeled carts
waiting to be ferried across. Drawn by ten, twenty,
and even as many as thirty oxen, these heavy hooded
vehicles travelled across country in a most wonderful
manner. Naturally they had to be of solid construction
to stand the wear and tear demanded of them. Their
wheels were heavy solid discs of hard wood encircled
by powerful tyres of iron. A primitive system of
brake&mdash;a mere bar of wood held in position by ropes&mdash;retarded
the speed of the vehicle down extra-steep
declivities. When going up or down hill the friction
of the wheels upon their axles produced a continuous
shrill whistle, which, when heard from a distance,
sounded not unlike the whistle of a locomotive. In
the deathly stillness of the Goyaz landscape those
whistles could be heard a long way off. The expectant
farmers&mdash;expectant, because those trading carts conveyed
to them a good deal of the food-stuff, salt, and
other necessaries of life, as well as the luxuries they
could afford&mdash;were clever at recognizing the whistles
of the various carts, and they identified one special
cart or another by what they poetically called the
"voice of the wheel" or the "song of Goyaz."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-70" id="Pg_1-70"></a>[<a href="images/1-70.png">70</a>]</span>
There were some picturesque rapids just above
the spot where we crossed the Corumb&aacute; River, which
flowed in a tortuous channel with a general direction
of W.S.W.</p>

<p>To the east of our track, as we proceeded northward,
stood a glorious range of hills with magnificent
grazing land extending for many miles. In front of
us to the north and N.N.E. towered a high plateau, the
Serra de Callos, also called, I believe, Serra do Cusuzeiro.</p>

<p>Still travelling up and down and across several
streamlets, we reached at sunset the Rio Boccagna
(2,230 ft. above the sea level), which, soon after passing
the place where we crossed it, entered the large river
Bagri, winding its way through a gorgeous forest.
We had passed during the day really wonderful grazing
land on either side of the track, but principally to the
east, between the north bank of the Corumb&aacute; River
and Camp Mazagan. There were plenty of small
streams in the hilly and sometimes slightly wooded
valleys.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock, having ridden that day 76 kil.,
we halted after dark at the <i>moradoria</i>, or farm, of
Mazagan (elev. 2,375 ft. above the sea level). We
were politely asked to enter the house, and immediately
preparations were made to clear out the best room
for me. The illumination was not grand: an ancient
metal arrangement&mdash;not unlike a Pompeian lamp&mdash;with
a wick soaked in oil profusely smoking. In the
dim light I could just distinguish in the background,
reclining against the wall, a youth with a guitar, from
which two chords&mdash;always the same two chords&mdash;were
strummed. The boy seemed in a trance over this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-71" id="Pg_1-71"></a>[<a href="images/1-71.png">71</a>]</span>
musical composition, and even our appearance had not
disturbed his efforts. He had taken no notice whatever
of us. Dinner was prepared&mdash;it took a long time&mdash;the
musician all the time delighting his admiring family
with the two monotonous chords.</p>

<p>"It is a pity," said his delighted mother to me,
"that we cannot send him to school. He is a genius;
he would astonish the world."</p>

<p>"Yes," I hastily agreed, "it <i>is</i> a pity you cannot
send him ... somewhere!"</p>

<p>"Can you not take him with you?"</p>

<p>I explained to the poor woman that it required
very civilized people to appreciate her son's music.
Among the wild Indians I expected to find, later on
in my journey, I was sure that with music like that,
we should all be killed; they were such savages!</p>

<p>After two solid hours&mdash;and the two chords still
continuing, with no signs whatever of relenting&mdash;I
asked the musical genius if he could treat me to a
different tune. Alas! he knew no other, but as he
saw that I was so fond of music he would again, with the
greatest pleasure, go on playing the same air&mdash;he called
it an air.</p>

<p>"<i>Muito obrigado!</i> (Thank you very much!)" I
moaned, with a sickly smile on my lips and a violent
internal wish to smash guitar and guitarist.</p>

<p>"<i>No hai de que!</i> (Do not mention it!)" and here
recommenced the repetition of the two chords.</p>

<p>"I should like to go to sleep now; thank you
very much again for the lovely music," I next
plaintively added, in my most approved Brazilian
politeness.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-72" id="Pg_1-72"></a>[<a href="images/1-72.png">72</a>]</span>
"Oh, not at all: I shall go on playing while you
are sleeping. It will give you pleasant dreams!"</p>

<p>It was too pathetic. Nothing short of murder could
have stopped his enthusiasm. Being a traveller of
years' experience, I was not to be outwitted. As he
would not stop the music, I stopped hearing it by
stuffing my ears tight with cotton-wool. So I slept
soundly enough, notwithstanding the orchestral entertainment.
At sunrise, when I opened my eyes again,
the boy was still at it. I removed the cotton from my
ears ... yes, indeed, the identical two chords!</p>

<p>The boy and the guitar will perhaps never know
what a narrow escape they both had! In despair I
gave orders to get the mules ready at once in order to
depart immediately.</p>

<p>Those halts in farmhouses were dreary beyond
words. The Brazilians of the interior&mdash;quite unlike
those of the big towns in or near the coast&mdash;were sullen
people, with no conversation&mdash;or else too much&mdash;no
interest in anything, no art, no imagination. They
were timid and vain to an incredible degree, suspicious,
avaricious, and easily offended, so that the greatest
tact had to be used with them. They were ignorant
of everything even in their own immediate neighbourhood.
Yet, mind you, with all that, extraordinarily
kind and ultra-polite of speech. They all seemed
turned out of the same mould. When you had seen
one you had seen them all. There were, of course, a
few exceptions&mdash;Brazilians of recent German, French,
Italian or Spanish origin&mdash;but these exceptions were
indeed very rare in the interior.</p>

<p>Ill-fed, his blood corrupted and impoverished to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-73" id="Pg_1-73"></a>[<a href="images/1-73.png">73</a>]</span>
utmost degree&mdash;his health, therefore, never in a normal
condition&mdash;his finances at the lowest ebb, the Brazilian
of the interior had little indeed to make him happy.
His home at best was as miserable and dirty as
possible. The room generally given to an honoured
guest&mdash;the best in the house&mdash;was the granary. More
than once was my camp-bed perched on a mound of
Indian corn. And the furniture? A wooden bench
of the roughest description&mdash;really an instrument of
torture rather than an article of comfort; a few wooden
pegs in the wall for hanging rifles or other things; an
occasional wooden bedstead; seldom, very seldom, a
stool or a chair&mdash;in any case, never a comfortable one
such as you invariably find with peasants and old-established
colonists of most other countries. They
cared not for comfort. Their beds, a mass of rags, were
shared by masters and hens and dogs. Everything was
in an abandoned state, everything had fallen to rack
and ruin. All looked as if they were tired of life, too
indolent to move. They seldom saluted when you met
them on the trail, nor when you entered their houses;
if they did, they rapidly touched their dilapidated hats
as if afraid to spoil them. Never did you perceive
a smile upon their long-drawn countenances. When
they greeted one another they laid their bodies close
together as if about to dance the <i>tango</i>, and patted each
other repeatedly on the shoulder-blades, turning their
heads away as if to avoid their reciprocal evil odour.
It is not the fashion in any part of Brazil to shake
hands. Some say it is because of the unpleasant feeling
of touching sweating hands; others suggest that it is
to prevent the contagion of the many skin complaints<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-74" id="Pg_1-74"></a>[<a href="images/1-74.png">74</a>]</span>
from which people suffer. When they do shake hands&mdash;with
a stranger, for instance&mdash;one might as well be
grasping the very dead hand of a very dead man; it
is done in so heartless a manner.</p>

<p>For a consideration they reluctantly gave a stranger
what little they possessed, but they had not the remotest
idea of the value of things. In one farmhouse
you were charged the equivalent of a few pence for
an egg or a chicken; in the next farm a small fortune
was demanded for similar articles of convenience. Men,
women, children, dogs, pigs and fowls, all lived&mdash;not
happily, but most unhappily&mdash;together.</p>

<p>No sooner were we able to saddle the animals and
pack the baggage and pay our hostess, than we tried
to make our escape from that musical farm. But luck
was hard on me that day. One mule was lost, a second
received a terrible gash in his hind quarters from a
powerful kick from another mule.</p>

<p>We went on among low, fairly grassy hills to the
west, W.N.W. and to the east of us. We still had
before us the Serra de Callos&mdash;a flat-topped tableland
some 12 kil. in diameter on the summit, where it was
almost circular. Its deeply grooved sides showed
clearly the great work of erosion which had occurred
and was still taking place in those regions. With the
exception of two spurs, which projected on the west
and east sides of the plateau, its sky-line was quite
clean and flat.</p>

<p>After rising to an elevation of 2,600 ft., then descending
to 2,450 ft., we crossed two streamlets which
afterwards joined a fairly important torrent. One was
called the Rio Boa Vista. We gradually then rose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-75" id="Pg_1-75"></a>[<a href="images/1-75.png">75</a>]</span>
to 2,750 ft. on another flat tableland to the east of the
Serra de Callos, with its sides eroded in two distinct
terraces, the higher one being almost a straight wall
from two-thirds up the side of the range. In the lower
portion a number of rounded mounds were to be
observed, which, with a stretch of the imagination
and for the sake of comparison, resembled, perhaps,
elephants' heads.</p>

<p>North-east of the Serra stood a thickly-wooded,
detached mound, while to the north as we went along
there was displayed before us a magnificent view of
the flat valley into which we were about to descend.</p>

<p>Where the country was wooded many trees and plants
were to be found, useful for their tanning, medicinal,
oliferous or lactiferous qualities: such as the Dedal,
a yellowish-leafed shrub from which a yellow dye can
be obtained; the tall thin Arariba Amarelho, or
Amarelhino (<i>Centrolobium robustum</i>), a great number
of Lobelia trees, with their elongated light green leaves
and clean barked stems, which eject, from incisions, a
caustic and poisonous juice. The tallest of all the
trees in that region was perhaps the Jacaranda, with its
tiny leaves.... There were four kinds of Jacaranda&mdash;the
Jacaranda <i>cabiuna</i>, <i>rosa</i>, <i>tan</i> and <i>violeta</i>, technically
known as <i>Dalbergia nigra</i>, <i>Mach&aelig;rium incorruptibile</i>,
<i>Mach&aelig;rium cencopterum</i>, <i>Mach&aelig;rium Alemanni</i>, Benth.
The three latter have a specific gravity higher than
that of most woods in Brazil, except the Pao de
ferro (<i>C&aelig;salpina ferrea</i>), the very plentiful Barbatimao
(<i>Stryphnodendron barbatimao</i>), a mimosa-like tree, and
the Vinhatico amarello (<i>Echyrosperum Balthazarii</i>),
the last of which has the highest specific gravity of all.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-76" id="Pg_1-76"></a>[<a href="images/1-76.png">76</a>]</span>
Then we found plenty of Sambaiba, an excellent
wood, and Imuliana, a wood of great resistance, much
used in certain parts of Brazil for constructing fences.</p>

<p>A peculiar tree with concave leaves shaped like a
cup was locally called Ariticun or Articun. It produced
a large fruit, quite good to eat.</p>

<p>Much botanical variety was indeed everywhere
around us.... There was the <i>terra da folha miuta</i>, which,
as its name tells, possessed minute shiny leaves; then
the tall Faveiro (<i>Pterodon pubescens</i>), producing a bean,
and having dark leaves not unlike those of mimosas.
Then, many were the kinds of acacias we noticed as we
went along.</p>

<p class="fsc">Picturesque Ox-carts of Goyaz.</p>
<hr />
<p>Still descending, we arrived at the little town of
Caldas de Goyaz&mdash;so called because there were three
hot springs of water of different temperatures. I
visited the three springs. The water tasted slightly
of iron, was beautifully clear and quite good to drink.
Two springs were found in a depression some 150 ft.
lower than the village&mdash;viz., at an elevation of 2,450 ft.,
whereas the village itself was at 2,600 ft. These two
springs were only 20 ft. away from a stream of cold
water. A short distance from the cold stream was
another stream of hot water emerging from the rocks.</p>

<p>Small rectangular tanks had been made at the two
higher springs, which were said to possess wonderful
curing qualities for eczema and other cutaneous troubles;
also for rheumatism and blood complaints of all kinds.
Whether those waters were really beneficial or not, it
was not possible to ascertain on a passing visit. I
drank some of the water and it did me no harm, so if
it does no good neither is it injurious.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-77" id="Pg_1-77"></a>[<a href="images/1-77.png">77</a>]</span>
The village of Caldas showed signs of having seen
better days. It was clean-looking, but like all other
villages of Goyaz it was dreary in the extreme. There
were only a few houses in the place, and each had a
shop; all the shops sold similar articles&mdash;nickel-plated
revolvers, spurs and daggers, calicoes, gaudy wearing-apparel,
perfumery, and so on.</p>

<p>For any one interested in the study of the effects of
erosion on a gigantic scale, no more suitable country
could be found than Central Brazil. Here again to the
E.N.E. of Caldas stood the Serra do Sapp&eacute;. In this
case it was not a tableland, like the Serra de Caldas,
but purely a hill range. The plateau of Serra de
Caldas, I was told, measured on its summit 12 kil.
by 18 kil.</p>

<p>Again, after leaving Caldas, we went through most
wonderful grazing ground to the north-east and east
of our route at the foot of the Serra do Sapp&eacute;. We
had descended to the Rio Lagiadi, 2,480 ft. above the
sea level, which flowed into the Pirapitinga River (a
tributary of the Corumb&aacute;). Once more did we admire
that evening the remarkable effect of solar radiation,
this time a double radiation with one centre&mdash;the sun&mdash;to
the west, and a second centre, at a point diametrically
opposite, to the east. Those radiations, with a
gradually expanded width, rose to the highest point of
the celestial vault, where they met. The effect was
gorgeous indeed, and gave the observer the impression
of being enclosed in the immeasurable interior of an
amazingly beautiful sea-shell turned inside out.</p>

<p>We arrived in the evening at the farm of Laza (elev.
2,450 ft.), where we had to abandon the wounded mule,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-78" id="Pg_1-78"></a>[<a href="images/1-78.png">78</a>]</span>
and also another which, on coming down a steep incline,
had badly injured its fore leg.</p>

<p>The pack-saddles used in the interior of Brazil
(Minas Geraes, Goyaz and Matto Grosso) were the
most impracticable, torturing arrangements I have
ever had to use on my travels. The natives swore by
them&mdash;it was sufficient for anything to be absurdly unpractical
for them to do so. It only led, as it did
with me at first, to continuous unpleasantness, wearying
discussions and eventual failure if one tried to diverge
from the local habits, or attempted to eradicate deeply-rooted
ideas.</p>

<p>Let me describe a typical Brazilian pack-saddle.
It weighed, with its inseparable protecting hide, well
over 90 lbs. It was bulky and cumbersome, most
difficult to lift and set right on the animal's back. It
consisted of two great parallel, clumsily-carved, heavy
U-shaped pieces of wood supported upright on two
enormous pads, at least double the size and thickness
necessary. The breast and tail pieces were of extra
thick leather of great width, which had the double
disadvantage of being heavy and of producing bad sores
by their constant friction and hard, saw-like, cutting
edges. Then the saddle allowed the loads to hang
much too low on the sides of the animal's body. This
naturally saved trouble and effort to the men who
packed the animals. Two of them simply lifted the
loads simultaneously on the two sides and hooked
them to the saddle by means of adjusted loops of leather
or rope. Then came the difficulty of keeping the loads
in position, so that they would not shift back and
forth. This was done by passing a leather thong over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-79" id="Pg_1-79"></a>[<a href="images/1-79.png">79</a>]</span>
all and under the animal's belly, which was then
squeezed beyond all measure. Result of this: continuous
trouble to pack rebellious animals, who knew
what was coming; painful marching for the animals,
who thus had difficulty in breathing, and therefore
extra long marches, almost an impossibility without
much injury to them. We will not speak of sore backs,
sore sides, sore chests, and sore tail root&mdash;which was a
matter of course after a pack animal had borne for a
few hours one of those torturing arrangements on its
back.</p>

<p>I had tried to adopt lighter saddles of a more practical
design, such as I had used on other expeditions;
but as this involved a different method altogether of
packing the animals, it led to much derision, unpleasantness,
and refusal to do the work except in their own
stupid way, so that in order to save time, expense and
trouble I had to conform, much against my will, to the
Brazilian method. It was an impossibility to induce
a Brazilian of the interior to agree that any other way
of doing anything was better or even as good as his
own.</p>

<p>A painful phase of human existence, as the country
became more and more sparsely inhabited, was the
number, relative to the population, of cases of sexual
insanity, due naturally to the great difficulty of intercourse.
We will not refer to sexual vices&mdash;extremely
common&mdash;which reduced the few inhabitants to a
state of absolute idiocy. Thus at Laza farm there
were only three women and no men. They were all of
a certain age, and for many many years had been there
alone, and had not seen a man. They had become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-80" id="Pg_1-80"></a>[<a href="images/1-80.png">80</a>]</span>
absolutely insane, and it required no little tact to prevent
a catastrophe. One&mdash;a repulsive, toothless black
woman, formerly a slave&mdash;was in such an excited state
of mind that I was really glad when I saw my troop
of animals started on the march early the next morning.</p>

<p>On April 6th we were still on the north side of the
Serra de Caldas, at the northernmost point of which
flowed a <i>riber&atilde;o</i>, or great river (elev. 2,450 ft.). Most
beautiful grazing land spread to the north of us, enormous
stretches of undulating country verdant with
delicious grass. The Sapp&eacute; Mountains were still visible
in the distance.</p>

<p>Marching through enchanting country&mdash;almost level,
or merely rising or descending a few feet&mdash;with a magnificent
view of distant mountains to our right and of
low flat plains and far-away tablelands to our left,
we arrived, after a morning's march of 36 kil., at the
fazenda of Pouso Alto (elev. 2,600 ft.).</p>

<p class="fsc">A Clever Automatic Pounding Machine.</p>
<hr />
<p>Outwardly Pouso Alto was by far the neatest-looking
fazenda we had yet seen since leaving Araguary, but
on entering the house the floor was a mass of dirt.
Fowls were running to and fro all over the rooms. A
rough table of Portuguese origin, a couple of benches
so dirty that one did not dare to sit on them, some
roughly made bedsteads, miserable and filthy&mdash;but no
washstands or basins, no articles of necessity were
anywhere to be observed or found. The mattresses&mdash;if
one can elevate them to the dignity of such a name:
they were mere bags filled with anything that had been
found handy, such as the leaves and stalks of Indian-corn,
wool and dried grass&mdash;were rolled up in the
daytime. Only one bed was still made up. On it a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-81" id="Pg_1-81"></a>[<a href="images/1-81.png">81</a>]</span>
cackling hen was busy laying an egg. That egg&mdash;a very
good egg&mdash;was triumphantly served to me for breakfast.</p>

<p>The walls of nearly all the farmhouses in the southern
part of the Province of Goyaz were made of wooden
lattice work, the square cavities formed by the cross
sticks being filled in and the whole plastered over with
mud, which eventually became hard when dry. Near
the foundations the walls were strengthened with mud
bricks half baked.</p>

<p>Evidently, as was the case with this particular old
house, in former days, when Goyaz was more prosperous
than it is now, in the time of the Emperor, most of the
houses were whitewashed&mdash;a luxury which in these days
of misery the farmers can no longer indulge in. The
doors and windows were rambling, though the frames
of them were generally solidly made, but one never saw
a pane of glass in any window anywhere in the country.
At night the people barricaded themselves tight into
their rooms and let no air in. It was partly due to
fear of attack. Whenever a building was whitewashed
one invariably saw on it the impression of its owner's
spread hand in outline, or else his signature in blue
paint. The favourite colours in house decoration&mdash;where
any were noticeable&mdash;were blue and a dirty
cinnabar red.</p>

<p>Dogs were numerous everywhere, and, like their
masters, were indolent and sleepy.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of that same day we travelled
some 13 kil. more, on practically level ground intersected
by a couple of streamlets. Marching through
thinly wooded country, grassy here and there, one began
to notice a variation in the scenery, which was gradually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-82" id="Pg_1-82"></a>[<a href="images/1-82.png">82</a>]</span>
becoming more tropical in appearance. Palm trees,
especially burity (<i>Mauritia vinifera</i> M.), in single specimens,
or in groups, could be seen in the great stretches
of good grazing country which appeared on both sides
of our course.</p>

<p>We spent the night at the fazenda of Ritiro Alegre
(elev. 2,450 ft.), which words translated mean "the
merry rest"&mdash;a most undeserved name, I can assure
you, for neither merriment nor rest was to be obtained
there. An evening in a Brazilian farm was, nevertheless,
occasionally not devoid of interest or of comic
scenes.</p>

<p>These folks evidently valued little the life of their
children. As I was sitting on the doorstep waiting
for my dinner to be cooked, down came, galloping at a
breakneck speed and riding bareback, a little child of
eight, carrying slung under his arm a smaller child of
one, the latter squealing terribly. They both landed
safely at the door. Then there appeared one of the
picturesque carts drawn by twelve oxen, anxiously
awaited by the family. Twenty snarling, snorting,
ill-natured pigs provided enough noise seriously to
impair the drums of one's ears; and when you added
to this the monotonous bellowing of cows and oxen,
the frantic neighing of horses and mules waiting to be
fed, the crowing of cocks and the cackling of hens, the
unmusical shrieks of a beautiful <i>arara</i> (or macaw, of
gorgeous green, blue, and yellow plumage), and of
two green parrots&mdash;to which total add, please, the
piercing yells of the children&mdash;it was really enough to
drive one insane.</p>

<p>They were superior farmers, those of the "Merry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-83" id="Pg_1-83"></a>[<a href="images/1-83.png">83</a>]</span>
Rest"&mdash;no one could doubt it when the lady of the
house and her pretty daughter arrived from an errand
and found strangers in the house. Dear me, what
style, what enchanting affectation, the pretty maid and
her mamma put on when they perceived us!... With
an air of solemnity that was really delightful, they each
offered us the tip of one finger for us to shake, and
spoke with such affectation that their words stumbled
one against the other. Their vocabulary was evidently
restricted, and in order to make the conversation elegant
they interpolated high-sounding words which did not
exactly belong, but sounded grand in their ears. It
was a trial to have to remain serious.</p>

<p>Dinner was served&mdash;always the same fare wherever
you went. Boiled rice (very badly boiled), beans,
stewed chicken chopped up, <i>pimienta</i> (peppers), fried
eggs and Indian corn flour, which one mixed up together
on one's plate and rendered into a paste. The
coffee was always plentiful and good, but so strong
that it was quite bitter.</p>

<p>By the light of a wick burning and smoking terribly
from the neck of an ex-medicine bottle filled with oil,
we enjoyed our meal, watched intently by the entire
family, silent and flattened in semi-obscurity against
the walls. The primitive lamp gave so little light&mdash;although
it gave abundant smell&mdash;that the many figures
were almost indistinguishable against the dirty background,
and all one perceived on raising one's eyes
from the dinner-plate was a row of expanded eyes,
following the movements of our hands, and just under
that row a row of white teeth.</p>

<p>When seen in a stronger light it was curious to notice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-84" id="Pg_1-84"></a>[<a href="images/1-84.png">84</a>]</span>
criminal characteristics on nearly every face one saw;
in the servants at those farmhouses one frequently
observed murderous-looking creatures whom one would
not care to meet alone in the dark. They were a
special breed of stranded outcasts who had drifted
there&mdash;the outcome of a complex mixture of Portuguese,
former black slaves, and Indians. When you
realized that the people who had drifted into the interior
were the worst Portuguese, the worst blacks, and the
Indians who intermarried with these gentry the worst
Indians, you can well imagine what fine results could
be expected from such a breed.</p>

<p>One trait predominant among these people was the
unreasonable jealousy of the men over their women.
Had they been so many Venuses of Milo the men could
not have guarded them with more ferocity. I am sure
it would take a brave man indeed, and, above all, a
totally blind man, to fall in love with the farmers'
wives, daughters, or servants of the Province of Goyaz.</p>

<p>I must say this in favour of my Brazilian men, that,
whatever other faults they may have had, they always,
behaved in a most chivalrous, dignified way with the
women-folk we met. Never once did I have to reprimand
them.</p>

<p>In the morning, as the cows were driven into the
yard to be milked, and the calves were being suckled
by their mothers, and the children, rubbing their
sleepy eyes with the backs of their hands, scrambled
out of the house upon their drowsy legs, the girls of
the family brought the last cups of coffee to us departing
strangers. We packed our animals, paid the bill, and
were off again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-85" id="Pg_1-85"></a>[<a href="images/1-85.png">85</a>]</span>
On April 7th we crossed the Piracanjuga River,
another tributary of the Corumb&aacute;, 50 yards wide,
flowing from north-east to south-west, at an elevation
of 2,300 ft. One league (6 kil. 600 m.) farther on we
crossed another stream flowing east, in its turn a tributary
of the Piracanjuga.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful trees in that region was
the <i>caneleira</i>, of the family of the <i>Laurineas</i>. Beautiful,
too, were the <i>oleo pardo</i> and <i>vermelho</i> (<i>Myrocarpus
frondosus</i> and <i>Myrospermum erythrozylon</i>).</p>

<p>We were next treated to a view of an extensive,
deliciously green valley, most excellent for grazing
purposes, extending from north to south to the west
of our route. In the central depression of this valley
were <i>burity</i> palms in abundance. They say that
wherever you find a burity you are sure to find water.
It is perfectly true, as the burity only flourishes where
there is a good deal of moisture in the soil.</p>

<p>Having crossed a low pass, we found ourselves in
another valley&mdash;this one sparsely wooded (2,500 ft.
above the sea level), very beautiful, with undulations
some 200 ft. high, and with streamlets at the bottom
of most of the undulations. The summit of the highest
elevation on that undulating land was 2,750 ft., the
level of the principal streamlet 2,600 ft. above the sea.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Twenty-nine</span> kilometres from the "Merry Rest" we
arrived at the little town of Pouso Alto&mdash;duly translated
"high camp"&mdash;situated 2,750 ft. above the sea level
on an elevation between the two rivers Piracanjuba,
and the Furmiga (which afterwards became the Rio
Meio Ponte<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing parenthesis">)</ins>, throwing itself into the Paranahyba River.</p>

<p>Pouso Alto was like all the other <i>villas</i> or settlements
of Goyaz, only perhaps a little larger. The
same whitewashed houses with doors and windows
decorated with blue, the same abandoned, deserted
look of the principal square and streets; in fact,
another "city of the dead." Only two men&mdash;drinking
in the local store&mdash;were visible in the whole village.</p>

<p>The usual impertinent questions had to be answered.</p>

<p>"Who are you? Why do you come here? Is
your country as beautiful as ours? Have you any
cities as large as ours in your country? How much
money have you? Are you married? You are
English; then you come here to steal our gold and
diamonds."</p>

<p>"Have you any gold and diamonds here?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-87" id="Pg_1-87"></a>[<a href="images/1-87.png">87</a>]</span>
"No, you cannot travel for pleasure. The English
only travel to take away all the riches from other
countries! Those instruments you carry" (a compass
and two aneroids) "are those that tell you where to
dig for gold!"</p>

<p>I could not help remarking to this gentleman that
so far the country I had traversed seemed merely to
be rich in misery, that was all.</p>

<p>Nothing could be imagined more funereal than
those little towns. My men intended remaining there
for the night, but I insisted on pushing on for a few
more kilometres&mdash;especially as in these places my men
were led to drink and became unmanageable. On we
went for 9 kil. to the farm of Bellianti (elev. 2,500 ft.
above the sea level).</p>

<p>On April 8th we made an early start and travelled
through a luxuriant forest, which was daily getting
more and more tropical as we went farther north. We
were, of course, do not forget, south of the equator.</p>

<p>Thirteen kilometres from camp we crossed the Rio
Furmiga (or Meio Ponte) about 100 yards wide, flowing
there in a direction from east to west at an elevation
of 2,000 ft. Most gorgeous, richly verdant vegetation
overhung and festooned the banks of the stream.</p>

<p>As we went farther toward the interior the vegetation
grew more beautiful, the people more repulsive.
The majority of the people suffered from go&icirc;tre in
more or less advanced stages. Many were the persons
affected by leprosy.</p>

<p>We were in a region where oranges (imported, of
course) of most excellent juicy quality were obtainable&mdash;for
instance at the farm of Felicidade (elev. 2,350 ft.).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-88" id="Pg_1-88"></a>[<a href="images/1-88.png">88</a>]</span>
All those farms&mdash;very old&mdash;showed signs of having seen
better days&mdash;no doubt when slavery existed in a legal
form in Brazil and it was possible to work those estates
profitably. With the prohibitive price of labour&mdash;and
in fact the impossibility of obtaining labour at any
price in the interior&mdash;farming cannot indeed flourish
to-day. The comparatively few immigrants who landed
at the various ports in Brazil were at once absorbed
near the coast, and seldom left the port of landing, where
labour was anxiously required.</p>

<p>For the first time, that day did I see two snakes,
which were concealed in the deep grooves left by a
cart wheel. One wound itself around the front leg of
my mule, and for a moment I was anxious lest the animal
had been bitten; but fortunately the snake, which had
been trodden upon, did no damage. Only rarely did
we see a bird anywhere, except in villages, where an
occasional crow, with its dried-up neck and jerky
motions, could be seen. How like the inhabitants those
birds were!</p>

<p class="figcenter">(The higher building is the church.)</p>
<hr />
<p>Twenty-seven kilometres farther we reached Santo
Antonio, a village situated in quite a heavenly spot,
2,800 ft. above the sea level, but in itself one of the
most miserable villages I have ever seen. There were
altogether some forty houses scattered about, eight of
which were along the sides of the principal square&mdash;an
abandoned field. The church had the appearance of
a disused barn. A large wooden cross stood in front
of it, upon which birds had built their nests. Four
thin, an&aelig;mic-looking palms stood at different angles
by the side of the cross. We had the misfortune to
stay there for the night. By seven o'clock everybody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-89" id="Pg_1-89"></a>[<a href="images/1-89.png">89</a>]</span>
had barricaded their houses and had retired to sleep.
There was, of course, no such thing as a post-office
or a telegraph in the place. The nearest place where a
letter could be posted was some 72 kil. away on the
high road between Goyaz and Catal&atilde;o. Goats tied in
pairs, with a log of wood between in order to keep them
apart, seemed to have the run of the place, and were
the only things there which appeared to have any life
in them.</p>

<p>But if the place was miserable, if the natives were
repulsive and dull, there was plenty to be thankful
for in admiration of the really glorious country around,
and the superb sunsets to which we were treated
every evening. Again that evening, when everybody
in the place was slumbering, the sunset was more
wonderful than words can describe. The usual radiations,
which again reached the highest point of the
sky's vault, were that night white on the west, with
corresponding ones of brilliant cobalt blue to the east.</p>

<p>A drizzling rain rendered the night cold and damp,
although the Fahrenheit thermometer registered a
minimum temperature of 70&deg;.</p>

<p>On leaving S. Antonio the trail ascended to a height
of 3,100 ft. (4&frac12; kil. from the village), and we were
then in a rich forest region, where the <i>acaju</i>&mdash;of the
<i>Terebinthace&aelig;</i> family&mdash;was plentiful, with its huge
leaves and contorted branches. The acaju produced
a refreshing fruit, either of a bright red or else of a
yellow colour, not unlike a large pepper, outside of
which was strongly attached a seed possessing highly
caustic qualities. Many <i>gordinha</i> trees were also to
be seen. It was interesting to see how those zones of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-90" id="Pg_1-90"></a>[<a href="images/1-90.png">90</a>]</span>
forest were suddenly succeeded by beautiful and vast
areas of grazing land, such as we found that day. We
crossed three streams at the respective elevations of
2,550 ft., 2,650 ft., and 2,750 ft., after which we reached
an elevation of 3,000 ft., the highest we had so far
attained on our route from the coast, where we found
ourselves on a grassy tableland of considerable beauty.
Looking back to the S.S.E., we perceived the two
hill ranges, one behind the other, which we had crossed.
Between them and us were marvellous slopes covered
with green grass, but not in the lower portion, where
bordering the stream was luxuriant forest. This was
noticeable also on a hill to the west, forming a minor
tableland with rounded sides.</p>

<p>To the N.N.E. was a perfectly flat plateau. The
distance rendered it of a deep blue, and its level sky-line
gave the appearance of the horizon upon the ocean,
except that there rose two small peaks which stood up
slightly above the elevation of the plateau. On all
that beautiful land only two small miserable farms
were to be seen. Yet it seemed to be a paradise on
earth&mdash;delightful climate, excellent soil, useful woods
in the forest, plenty of delicious water.</p>

<p>Three more streamlets flowing from west to east
were encountered at elevations of 2,700 ft., 2,750 ft.
and 2,800 ft., with undulating grassy land between of
wonderful beauty.</p>

<p>Having deviated somewhat from our route, we at
last descended into a grassy valley&mdash;absolutely flat&mdash;the
best of all we had seen. It had been fenced all round.
Upon inquiry, I learned that it had been acquired by
the Redemptionist Friars. There is one thing friars<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-91" id="Pg_1-91"></a>[<a href="images/1-91.png">91</a>]</span>
certainly know. It is how to select the best land
anywhere to settle upon.</p>

<p>We had travelled 46 kil. 200 m. that day when we
arrived at Campinas (elev. 2,550 ft. above the sea level)&mdash;the
usual kind of filthy village with tiny, one-storied
houses, more like toys than real liveable habitations.
This time the doors and windows were bordered with
grey instead of blue. On nearing those villages in Central
Brazil one frequently found an abundance of rough
wooden crosses scattered upon the landscape. They
marked the spots where individuals had been killed.</p>

<p>In the room where I put up in the village, in the
<i>hospedagem</i>, or rest-house, the floor was besmeared
with blood, the result of a recent murder. The shops
grew more and more uninteresting as we got farther
into the interior. The difficulties of transport were
naturally greater, the prices rose by leaps and bounds,
as we got farther; the population got poorer and poorer
for lack of enterprise. The articles of luxury and
vanity, so frequently seen in shops before, were now
altogether absent, and only bottles of inferior liquor
and beer were sold, matches and candles&mdash;that was
all. No trade, no industry, no money, existed in those
places. If one happened to pay with a five- or a ten-milreis
note (6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> or 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>), one could never obtain
change. Frequently, unless you wished to leave the
change behind, you were obliged to carry away the
balance in cheap stearine or beer. I took the stearine.
A short distance from the town was a seminary, with
four German friars, very fat, very jolly, very industrious.</p>

<p>Alcides, one of my men, was by way of being a
veterinary surgeon. Here is how he cured a wounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-92" id="Pg_1-92"></a>[<a href="images/1-92.png">92</a>]</span>
mule, which, having received a powerful kick from
another animal, displayed a gash 3 in. long in her
back, and so deep that the entire hand could be inserted
and actually disappear into the wound. Francisco,
another of my men, having duly and firmly tied
the animal's legs&mdash;a sensible precaution&mdash;proceeded
with his naked arm to search for <i>bishus</i>: anything
living is a <i>bishu</i> in Brazil, from an elephant to a flea;
but in this particular case it was applied to insects,
such as <i>carrapatos</i>, maggots, or parasites, which might
have entered the wound. Having done this at considerable
length and care, he proceeded to tear off with
his nails the sore edges of the laceration, after which
he inserted into the gash a pad of cotton-wool soaked
in creoline. That was the treatment for the first day.
The second day, the wound proceeding satisfactorily,
he inserted into it, together with his hand, a whole
lemon in which he had made a cut, and squeezed its
juice within the raw flesh. The amazing part of it
all was that the animal, with an additional bath or
two of salt and water, absolutely recovered from the
wound and got perfectly well.</p>

<p>The Redemptionist monks had a fine vineyard
adjoining their monastery&mdash;the only one of any size
and importance we had seen since leaving the railway&mdash;and
also some lovely orange groves in a walled
enclosure. They had built a mill on the bank of the
stream. Most of that beautiful valley for miles and
miles belonged to them. The town of Campinas&mdash;not
to be confounded with Campinas of S&atilde;o Paulo
Province&mdash;had a population of 600 souls.</p>

<p>When we left that place the next morning, again we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-93" id="Pg_1-93"></a>[<a href="images/1-93.png">93</a>]</span>
went across beautiful flat stretches of grassy land&mdash;several
miles long and broad&mdash;regular tablelands, at an
elevation of 2,700 ft.&mdash;most wonderful pasture lands
now going absolutely to waste. Plentiful streamlets
intersected those lovely meadows at a slightly lower
elevation&mdash;merely a few feet&mdash;where the water had
eroded itself a channel. Those streams were generally
bordered by a thick growth of trees and entangled
vegetation. We stopped for lunch at the farm of <i>Boa
Vista</i> (Belvedere or Fine View), so called&mdash;according
to the usual Brazilian way of reasoning&mdash;because it
was situated in a deep hollow from which you could
see nothing at all! Another more rational name
which this place also possessed was Bocca do Matto
(Mouth of the Forest), because it truly was at the
entrance of a thick forest extending to the north.</p>

<p>We went, in fact, from that point through densely
wooded country, although the trees were of no great
height or size. The ground was swampy and sloppy,
most unpleasant for marching, for some nineteen kilometres,
until we arrived at Goyabeira (elev. 2,700 ft.),
having covered 56 kil. 100 m. that day&mdash;not at all
bad marching considering that we could not change
animals and we conveyed all our baggage along with us.</p>

<p>I saw that day another snake, called by the natives
<i>duas cabecas</i> (and Tu Nou), or double-headed snake,
because its marking gives that impression at first sight.</p>

<p>After leaving Goyabeira the thick growth continued
over several ridges, the highest of which was 2,950 ft.,
with streams between at elevations respectively of
2,630 and 2,700 ft. I noticed in the forest some
beautiful paneira trees, with their trunks enlarged near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-94" id="Pg_1-94"></a>[<a href="images/1-94.png">94</a>]</span>
the base&mdash;a regular swelling all round. One of the
peculiarities of this tree was that it produced a
kind of vegetable wool contained within fairly hard
capsules.</p>

<p>That was indeed a day of surprises for us. As we
were proceeding over another hill range between two
streams (elev. 2,850 ft.), we saw at last some butterflies
of a gorgeous lemon yellow, some of a rich orange,
others of red and black, great numbers of pure white,
and some huge ones of an indescribably beautiful
metallic blue colour. There were swarms of them
near the water. So unaccustomed were they to see
human beings that many settled on my white coat
and on my straw hat and came along undisturbed for
long distances upon my person. They were so beautiful
that I had not the desire to kill them, even for the
sake of bringing back a valuable collection. It would
have been easy to capture them, as you could touch
them several times with your fingers before they would
fly away. One butterfly particularly took a great
fancy to my left hand, in which I held the reins of my
mule, and on which it sat during our marches for several
days&mdash;much to my inconvenience, for I was afraid of
injuring it. It would occasionally fly away and then
return. At night while we were camping I transferred
it to my straw hat, on which it quietly remained until
the next morning. The moment I had mounted my
mule, the butterfly would at once fly again to my hand.
This great affection was due chiefly, I believe, not to
any magnetic attraction, but merely to the delicately
scented soap which I used in my morning bath, and
which greatly attracted the butterfly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-95" id="Pg_1-95"></a>[<a href="images/1-95.png">95</a>]</span>
On many occasions on that expedition I had similar
experiences with butterflies.</p>

<p>For the first time, too, I perceived that day a few
<i>colibris</i>&mdash;tiny humming-birds of wonderful plumage.</p>

<p>Twenty-three kilometres from Goyabeira&mdash;after
many ups and downs along a deep-channelled, slushy
trail, and having crossed over several swampy, troublesome
streamlets&mdash;we suddenly emerged into a marvellous
undulating open plain with lovely grass and
numerous fat cattle grazing upon it. In the distance
upon the hill-side four or five farm-sheds could be
perceived. We had stopped at one farm on the way
in hopes of getting food, but they could only sell us
some <i>feij&atilde;o</i>&mdash;beans soaked in lard&mdash;so that it was with
some haste that we directed our mules to the more
imposing building in expectation of finding there at
least some rice and eggs. We hurriedly crossed the
plain and then the stream, and halted at the Cachoeira
Grande (Grand Rapid) farm, 2,950 ft. above the sea
level. A pure negro was in charge of the place, whose
wife was also as black as the ace of spades. Curiously
enough, they possessed a child much discoloured and
with golden hair and blue eyes. Such things will
happen in the best regulated countries. The black
man swore it was his own child, and we took&mdash;or,
rather, did not take&mdash;his word for it.</p>

<p>We went on thirteen more kilometres that afternoon,
when we were overtaken by a hurricane and torrential
rain which drenched us to the marrow of our bones.
We halted for the night at the farm of <i>Lagoa formosa</i>
(Beautiful Lagoon), 3,000 ft. above the sea level.</p>

<p>It was on April 12th that we proceeded to climb<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-96" id="Pg_1-96"></a>[<a href="images/1-96.png">96</a>]</span>
the dividing range between the waters flowing south
into the Paranahyba (afterward called the Parana)
River, and those flowing north eventually into the
Amazon. This range of mountains was by some called
Serra de Sta. Rita, by others Serra Dourada. It was
not possible to ascertain the real name from the local
people, who could tell me the names of no place, or
mountain, or stream, and hardly knew the names of
their own homes.</p>

<p>On a flat expanse some 13 kil. from Lagoa Formosa
we came upon a small lake. We travelled mostly across
campos (or prairies), with waters from that point flowing
northward. Seventeen kilometres farther we entered the
neat-looking village of Curralhino (elev. 2,600 ft.), with
two squares and streets actually with names to them.
We were from this point on the main route between
S&atilde;o Paulo and the capital of Goyaz, and also met there
the telegraph line between Goyaz and S&atilde;o Paulo.</p>

<p>We were getting near the capital of the province.
A little more life was noticeable in this settlement
than in those we had met before. Caravans of mules
and horses occasionally passed through, and bullock-carts,
with eighteen and twenty oxen, slowly and
squeakily crept along. We were going through a region
that was more than hilly&mdash;almost mountainous&mdash;the
first of the kind we had encountered since leaving
the railway.</p>

<p class="fsc">Burity Palms.</p>
<hr />
<p>At Camp Maria Alves we were at an elevation of
3,000 ft. Beautiful crystals were to be found at and
near this place. Many were enclosed in hard envelopes
of yellow lava, which contained besides semi-crystallized
matter easily crushed&mdash;to be strictly accurate,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-97" id="Pg_1-97"></a>[<a href="images/1-97.png">97</a>]</span>
the imprisoned infinitesimal crystals were easily separated,
under gentle pressure. Some spherical balls
and pellets of lava I picked up, when split contained
red baked earth which had evidently been subjected
to intense heat. In the centre of these pellets one or
more crystals of great clearness were invariably to be
found. These pellets must have been expelled with
terrific force from a volcanic vent, and must have
travelled great distances, for the depression where I
found them had a surface of alluvial formation.</p>

<p>On April 13th we again rose over a range where we
encountered a good deal of igneous rock and quantities
of beautiful crystals. We had a range to the west of
us and one higher and more important to the north-east,
the latter more broken up than any we had so
far seen in the three last provinces crossed. We somehow
missed now the lovely pasture lands of the day
before, so refreshing to the eye, and the landscape had
suddenly become more rugged and barren, except near
water. Some 9 kil. from the farm Maria Alves the Uru
or Uruba River (elev. 2,550 ft.) flowed north&mdash;there
merely a picturesque torrent among rocks and overhanging
vegetation on both banks.</p>

<p>The wonderful effect of erosion was noticeable on
the mountain sides to the north of us, where it had
left a top terrace with deep corrugations in the lower
sides of the mountain. A miserable-looking farmhouse
could be seen here and there&mdash;quite as miserable as the
country in itself was rich. Some shaggy policemen,
in rags and barefooted, passed us, guarding an ox-cart
dragging treasure to the capital. Only the oxen and
some cows which were about looked at us with interest,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-98" id="Pg_1-98"></a>[<a href="images/1-98.png">98</a>]</span>
and sniffed us&mdash;it is wonderful how quick animals
are at detecting the presence of strangers&mdash;but the
people took no notice of us. Here and there a tumbled-down
tree blocked the way. There were tracts of
pasture land. My men were considerably excited on
seeing a poisonous snake crawl swiftly towards our
mules. It was perhaps an absent-minded or a short-sighted
snake, for no sooner did it realize our presence
than it quickly veered round to escape. My men
killed it.</p>

<p>At an elevation of 2,550 ft. we met a limpid stream
of most delicious water. At that particular spot it
flowed south.</p>

<p>We were now confronted with a range of actual
mountains. The trail took us over wonderful rugged
scenery, masses of pillar-like grey rock of granitic
formation. On the summit of the pass we were over
strata of half-solidified tufa in sheets&mdash;or foliated&mdash;easily
crumbled and finely powdered between one's
fingers. The strata were at an angle of 45&deg;, showing
that they had undergone some disturbance. They had
been subjected to great heat, for in some places they
had been hard baked, which rendered them of a yellowish
brown colour. On the left of us&mdash;to the west&mdash;a great
vertical pillar of rock plainly showed the stratification,
the continuation of which could be followed
on the opposite side of the pass, both in the horizontal
strata and those which had been forced up at an angle.
Looking back from the pass, we obtained a heavenly
panorama of wooded hills to the south-east, far, far
beyond in the background, and of glorious campos
between them and us. With the winter coming on&mdash;of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-99" id="Pg_1-99"></a>[<a href="images/1-99.png">99</a>]</span>
course you know that south of the equator they have
their winter when we have our summer&mdash;beautiful
yellowish, reddish and brown tints of the foliage added
picturesqueness to the landscape.</p>

<p>The pass itself was 2,850 ft. above the sea level.
There was not much in the way of vegetation, barring
a few stunted <i>sucupira</i> trees. The air was exquisitely
pure and the water of two streamlets at 2,550 ft.
delicious and cool. We were marching over quantities
of marble fragments and beautiful crystals, which
shone like diamonds in the sun. Having gone over
the pass, we came upon a most extraordinary geological
surprise. There seemed to have been in ages long
gone by a great subsidence of the region north of us.
We were then on the steep edge of what remained of
the plateau, and down, down in the depth below was
an immense valley in which Goyaz city lay.</p>

<p>To the west of us&mdash;as I stood impressed by that
awe-striking scene&mdash;we had the irregularly-cut continuation
of the edge of the plateau on which we stood,
supported as it were on a pillar-like granitic wall of
immense height and quite vertical, resting on a gently
sloping base down to the bottom of the vast basin
below.</p>

<p>This great natural wall of gneiss, which contained
myriads of crystals and mica schists, shone like silver
in the spots where the sun struck it, and with the lovely
pure cobalt blue of the distant hills, the deep green
of the valley below, and the rich brown and yellow
and red tints of the near foreground, made one of the
most exquisitely beautiful sights I have ever witnessed.
The nearest approach to it in my experience was,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-100" id="Pg_1-100"></a>[<a href="images/1-100.png">100</a>]</span>
perhaps, the eastern escarpment of the Abyssinian
plateau in Africa, where a similar panorama on a much
smaller scale could be seen, but not the same geological
formation.</p>

<hr />
<p>No sooner had I recovered from the strangeness
and marvellous beauty of Nature's work around me,
than I felt a great shock at seeing what men had done
in that region. We were at this point on the high
road between S&atilde;o Paulo, Uberaba and Goyaz capital.
As my animals stumbled down the steep escarpment
traces could be seen of what must have been formerly
a beautiful paved road, well-drained on both sides with
channels, and held up in terraces by stone works where
the gradient was steepest. Here and there bits still
remained, demonstrating how well the road had been
made. But, uncared for and abandoned, most of it
had been washed away by the heavy rains, which had
turned that road into a foaming torrent in wet weather.
Near habitations, the well-cut slabs with which the
road was paved had come convenient to the natives
for building purposes. During the time of the Emperor
Pedro II., I was told, that was a magnificent road,
kept in excellent repair.</p>

<p>Goyaz city lay before us down, down below, in the
hollow of the huge depression. Its single row of low
whitewashed houses of humble architectural pretensions
became less and less impressive and less picturesque as
one got nearer. I had by that time grown quite accustomed
to this optical disillusion, for it was frequently
the case with the work of man in Brazil. It always
needed distance&mdash;the greater distance the better&mdash;to
lend enchantment to it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-101" id="Pg_1-101"></a>[<a href="images/1-101.png">101</a>]</span>
With a feeling of intense oppression&mdash;perhaps due
to the stifling air and the lower elevation (1,950 ft.)
at which Goyaz city lay&mdash;we entered the capital of
Goyaz. At the sound of our mules upon the pavement,
timid men, timid women and children cautiously peeped
from each window through the half-closed Venetian
blinds. We only had to turn round to peep at them,
and with terrified squeals the hidden creatures banged
and bolted the windows. The sight of a stranger in
Goyaz was apparently an event. Whether we were
expected or not, I do not know, but the whole population
seemed to be hiding behind the tiny windows
to look at us. The few who were caught in the street
seemed as if they wanted to bow but had not the
courage to do it. Indeed, their timidity was intensely
amusing. Some, more courageous, gave a ghastly
grin, displaying rows of irregular teeth in a terrible
condition of decay.</p>

<h2><a name="I_CHAPTER_VII" id="I_CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In the City of Goyaz</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was no such thing as an hotel in Goyaz capital.
The nearest approach to it was a filthy rest-house
for muleteers, which was, furthermore, already full.
Against my usual custom&mdash;as I never, unless absolutely
necessary, make use of the credentials I carry for my
private needs&mdash;I had, therefore, to apply to the Presidente
or Governor of the Province to find some sort of
accommodation in the town for my animals, men, and
myself.</p>

<p>"Take off your spurs before you enter!" roughly
shouted a sentry at the Governor's palace&mdash;a huge
barn-like structure&mdash;just as I was stooping to do that
before being asked.</p>

<p>"Do not stand on the pavement," said the sentry
again, anxious to display his authority.</p>

<p>Being a law-abiding person I shifted to one side.</p>

<p>"Do not stop under the Presidente's window!"
cried the policeman angrily once more, digging me in
the ribs with his bayonet.</p>

<p>I was beginning to be sorry I had not brought an
aeroplane with me in order to complete my toilet in
the air before entering so sacred a precinct, but patience<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-103" id="Pg_1-103"></a>[<a href="images/1-103.png">103</a>]</span>
being one of my chief virtues I transferred myself to
the remotest point across the square, where, stork-like,
upon one foot at a time I was able&mdash;this time undisturbed&mdash;to
remove both spurs.</p>

<p>"Take off your hat before entering," again shouted
the policeman, as I was still some fifteen yards from
the door.</p>

<p>I really began to feel rather nervous, with all those
orders grunted at me. I wondered at the strange
people who must visit the palace to have to be instructed
to such an extent before entering. I also stopped for
a moment to ponder whether I had taken off all that
was necessary to enter a palace where so much etiquette
was required.</p>

<p>The moment I entered things were different. I was
ushered into an ante-room, where I had to go through
a short cross-examination by some police officers. Then,
when they had made sure of my identity, they immediately
led me before the Presidente.</p>

<p>The Presidente greeted me with effusion. He was
a most polished and charming gentleman from Rio de
Janeiro, had travelled extensively in Europe, and could
speak French and English. He roared heartily when I
told him of my experience outside his palace.</p>

<p>"They are all savages here," he told me; "you
must not mind. The sentry has orders to keep everybody
away from the palace, as people come in the
afternoon and squat under my windows to jabber, and
I cannot sleep. Those orders, I assure you, were not
meant for you. You will be my guest all the time you
are in the city, and I can accept no excuse."</p>

<p>The Presidente placed a small house near the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-104" id="Pg_1-104"></a>[<a href="images/1-104.png">104</a>]</span>
palace at my disposal, and insisted on my having
all meals with his family&mdash;most refined, handsome,
exquisitely polite wife and daughters.</p>

<p>I presented the credentials I possessed from the
Minister of Agriculture in Rio and the Brazilian Ambassador
in London, requesting the Presidente to do all
in his power to further the success of the expedition&mdash;I,
of course, paying all expenses. The Presidente, like
most other Brazilians of a certain age, was <i>blas&eacute;</i> beyond
words. Nothing interested him except his family, and
life was not worth living. He believed in nothing. He
was an atheist because he had not been as successful
as he wished in the world, and attributed the fault to
God. He cared little about the future of his country.
If his country and all his countrymen went to a warmer
place than Heaven, he would be glad to see them go
that way! As for going exploring, mapping unknown
regions, studying the country and the people, building
roads, railways and telegraphs, it little mattered to
him, but it seemed all nonsense.</p>

<p>"Instead of coming to these wild, deadly regions,
why do you not go and spend your money enjoying
yourself in Paris or Vienna?" was his advice to
me.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I need a change occasionally, and I enjoy
things all the more by contrast when I return to
Europe."</p>

<p>The Presidente was evidently not in good health
and spirits. He was a Senator of the Republic, and
a man formerly of great ambitions, which were more
or less shattered when he was elected Governor of
Goyaz Province, with its population of corpses, and at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-105" id="Pg_1-105"></a>[<a href="images/1-105.png">105</a>]</span>
a salary of &pound;40 a month&mdash;very little more than I paid
my head muleteer&mdash;so that little could be expected
from the Governor of such a Province.</p>

<p>It was thus that the State of Goyaz, one of the
naturally richest in Brazil&mdash;it contained pasture lands
unique for their beauty, forests with valuable woods,
plenty of water and great navigable rivers draining
it both north and south, of which it was sufficient to
mention the magnificent Araguaya River, the Rio
Tocantins and the Paranahyba (or Parana)&mdash;was
instead one of the poorest. In the very heart of
Brazil, Goyaz was geographically and politically the
centre of the Republic. With an area of 747,311 sq. kil.
(288,532 sq. miles), the Province had an estimated
population of some 280,000 souls, or less than one to
every square mile.</p>

<p>The region forming the present State of Goyaz was
first explored in 1647 by Manoel Correa, a native of
S&atilde;o Paulo, and in 1682 by another Paulista, Bartholomeu
Bueno de Silva, who both were prospecting for
gold. The latter was successful in locating gold mines
and in making friends with the local Indians of the
Goyaz tribe, from whom the Province then took its
name. Some forty-three years later de Silva returned
to S&atilde;o Paulo with 918 ounces of gold. The news of
these goldfields quickly attracted a great number of
adventurers to Goyaz. The country then saw its most
prosperous days, especially in and near Villa Boa, the
present city of Goyaz, where gold was said to have been
plentiful in those days.</p>

<p>The enterprising Bartholomeu Bueno de Silva returned
to Goyaz in 1731 as a Capit&atilde;o Mor, or Grand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-106" id="Pg_1-106"></a>[<a href="images/1-106.png">106</a>]</span>
Captain, with the right to dispose of land. In 1822
Goyaz was recognized as a Province of the Empire,
and subsequently in 1869 it became one of the States
of the Union, with autonomy as regards local affairs
under its own Constitution approved by the Federal
Constituent Assembly in 1891.</p>

<p>Cattle, horse and mule breeding on a small scale
was the chief source of income of that magnificent
State&mdash;an income which in less indolent hands might
be increased ten-thousand-fold or more. Its horses and
mules found a ready market in the adjacent State
of Matto Grosso and from there went into Bolivia,
while the States of Minas Geraes and S&atilde;o Paulo were
the chief buyers of pigs, <i>toucinho</i> (dried pork fat), dried
beef, hides raw and cured, cheese, lard, etc.</p>

<p>Goyaz prided itself greatly on its horses, which
enjoyed a certain fame all over Brazil. Perhaps they
were in a way as good as any produced in the Republic.
With a little study and care in the breeding they
might be greatly improved and rendered as sturdy and
good-looking as some horses of Asia and Northern
Africa. So far they were far inferior in appearance
and endurance to the horses of Arabia, Turkestan,
Europe and Abyssinia.</p>

<p>The most interesting type of the Goyaz horse was
what is called the <i>curraleiro</i> or "stable horse," bred
in the north of the State, especially in the valley
of Paranan, bordering upon Minas and Bahia. The
curraleiro was also known as <i>cavallo sertanejo</i> or
"horse of the jungle"&mdash;two most inappropriate names,
for it was, accurately speaking, neither one nor the
other.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-107" id="Pg_1-107"></a>[<a href="images/1-107.png">107</a>]</span>
The Goyaz horse was a typical Brazilian horse. It
shared many of the characteristics of the people of
the Province. Timidity, laziness, lack of affection and
judgment, sulkiness and great stubbornness under training
of any kind were its qualities. This was due chiefly,
I think, to its inferior intelligence when compared with
thoroughbred horses of other nations. The Goyaz
horse was small, fairly agile, and when well cared for
had a handsome shiny coat with luxuriant mane and
tail. It was capable of short, noteworthy efforts, but
did not possess abnormal endurance.</p>

<p>The present curraleiro is a mere degeneration of
what must have formerly been an excellent horse.
Considering the absolute lack of care taken in its breeding,
it was certainly remarkable that it proved to be as
good a horse as it actually was. Judiciously crossed
with Hungarian, Turkestan, Arab or Abyssinian horses,
I think that quite excellent results might be obtained.
It must be taken into consideration that great hardships
and work of the roughest character were demanded of
animals in Central Brazil.</p>

<p>A praiseworthy movement was started some years
ago by Marechal Hermes da Fonseca, now President
of the Republic, to mount the entire Brazilian Cavalry
on national horses. That will perhaps lead some day
to a great improvement in the breeding of animals
all over the country, and especially in Goyaz, which
provided the most suitable land for that purpose. The
same remarks could, perhaps, in a slightly lesser degree,
be applied to the breeding of donkeys and mules. No
care whatever was exercised by the breeders in order to
improve the breeds. Everything was left to luck and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-108" id="Pg_1-108"></a>[<a href="images/1-108.png">108</a>]</span>
chance. The result was that a degenerate type of
animal was produced&mdash;wonderful indeed, considering
the way it was bred, but which might be improved to
an immense extent and made into a remarkable animal,
in such a propitious climate and with such marvellous
pasture lands.</p>

<p>With cattle also, it is safe to assert that, since the
colonial time, very little fresh foreign blood of any
importance has been introduced in breeding&mdash;except,
perhaps, some inferior types of the Indian humped
zebu. Most of the stock I saw in Southern Goyaz was
intermixed with zebu. The formerly existing bovine
races, such as the Mocha, Cora&ccedil;u and Crioula have now
almost altogether disappeared.</p>

<p>Unlike most other States of Brazil, Goyaz had no
Provincial Customs duties. With its immense frontier,
bordering upon seven different other States, it would
be impossible to enforce the collection of payments.
No reliable statistics were obtainable as to the amount
of exports or imports of the State. Even approximately
it would be impossible to make a guess as to
the actual amount of the resources of the State.</p>

<p>Sugar-cane and tobacco could be profitably grown
in the State. The small quantity of tobacco grown
there was of excellent quality.</p>

<p>The Government of Goyaz Province consisted of
three Powers: the Executive, represented by the
President, elected for three years by universal suffrage;
the Legislature&mdash;a Chamber of Deputies equally elected
for three years by suffrage; and a Judicial power constituted
by the High Court of Justice, <i>Juges de droit</i>&mdash;law
judges&mdash;and District Judges. To be elected Presi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-109" id="Pg_1-109"></a>[<a href="images/1-109.png">109</a>]</span>dent
of Goyaz State all that was necessary was to be
a Brazilian citizen, over thirty years of age, and able
to read and write. The same applied to the election
of Deputies&mdash;for whom a residence of only two years
in the State was sufficient.</p>

<p>The capital of Goyaz&mdash;situated on the Rio Vermelho,
a tributary of the great Araguaya River&mdash;had, according
to the census of 1900, a population of some 13,475
people, but I rather doubt whether it possessed as many
as 8 to 10,000 souls when I visited it. One could notice
indications that Goyaz had been in days gone by a
flourishing place. There were a number of fine churches,
and a large cathedral in course of construction&mdash;but
since abandoned. Some of the buildings, too&mdash;the
finest was the prison&mdash;must have been quite handsome,
but were now in a dilapidated condition. It was
really heart-breaking to see such a magnificent country
go to rack and ruin&mdash;a State naturally the richest
perhaps in Brazil, yet rendered the poorest, deeply
steeped in debt, and with the heavy weight of absurdly
contracted loans from which it had no hope whatever
of recovering under present conditions. They had in
the province the most beautiful land in Brazil, but it
was a land of the dead. People, industries, trade, commerce,
everything was dead. Formerly, in the time
of the Emperor and of that great patriot General
Couto de Magalh&atilde;es, Goyaz city could be reached&mdash;within
a few kilometres&mdash;by steam on the beautiful
river Araguaya, which formed the western boundary of
the province, an ideal waterway navigable for 1,200 kil.&mdash;in
Goyaz province alone. In the time of the Emperor,
when Brazil was a wild country, steam navigation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-110" id="Pg_1-110"></a>[<a href="images/1-110.png">110</a>]</span>
actually existed up the Araguaya River from Concei&ccedil;&atilde;o
as far as Leopoldina (the port for Goyaz city). The
river was free from obstacles of any kind, even in the
rainy season. There were then three beautiful English-built
launches on that service. A fine repairing shop
had been erected at Leopoldina.</p>

<p>But in these days of civilization, order and progress,
the steamers have been purposely run aground and
left to rot. There was actually a tree growing through
the hull of one of those launches when I last heard of
them; the machine shop was robbed of all its tools,
and the machinery destroyed and abandoned. The
Presidente told me that the Provincial Government
had eventually bought the wrecks of the launches
and the machine shops for &pound;20&mdash;and as it cost too
much to leave a man in charge everything had since
been abandoned.</p>

<p>When I visited Goyaz there was no sign and no
hope of re-establishing steam navigation on that marvellous
waterway.</p>

<p>The Tocantins River, which intersected the Province
from Goyaz city to its most northern point, was
also another serviceable stream&mdash;but no one used it,
except, perhaps, some rare private canoe taking up
goods to settlements on its banks.</p>

<p>The navigation of the Tocantins, when I was in
Goyaz, extended merely to the Port of Alcoba&ccedil;a, 350 kil.
from Para, from which point rapids existed which
made steam navigation impossible as far as Praia da
Rainha. The distance of 180 kil. between those two
places was eventually to be traversed by a railway, a
a concession for which had been granted to the Estrada<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-111" id="Pg_1-111"></a>[<a href="images/1-111.png">111</a>]</span>
de Ferro Norte do Brazil. In the High Tocantins I
believe two steam launches were temporarily running
as far as Porto Nacional or perhaps a little higher.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the State of Goyaz will some day,
notwithstanding its apathetic inhabitants, see great
changes for the better. The new epoch will begin
when the several railways which were in course of
construction from various directions enter the Province.
Not one of them had penetrated the Province
at the time of my visit, although the work of preparing
the road had just been begun on Goyaz territory, as
we have seen, for a few kilometres north of the Paranahyba
River, on the extension of the Mogyana line from
S&atilde;o Paulo. A second railway line in course of construction
was a branch of the Western Minas Railway;
and there was a third up the Araguaya from Para.
Those railways will certainly revolutionize the country.
The inhabitants of Goyaz, ultra-conservative in their
ideas, were not at all anxious to see a railway reach
their capital. In their curious way of reasoning they
seemed to think that the railway would make life
dearer in the city, that strangers would be coming in
great numbers to reap the benefit of their country,
and that the younger people who were satisfied to live
there&mdash;because they could not get away&mdash;would all fly
to the coast as soon as the railway was established,
to enjoy the luxuries of Rio and S&atilde;o Paulo, of which
they had heard, but could so far only dream of. They
did not stop to think that the railways will certainly
make Goyaz the richest country in the world.</p>

<p>The financial condition of that beautiful State can
perhaps best be shown by quoting the words of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-112" id="Pg_1-112"></a>[<a href="images/1-112.png">112</a>]</span>
Presidente himself in his message to the Legislative
Congress of Goyaz on May 13th, 1910, on assuming
the Presidency of the Province.</p>

<p>"On my assuming the Government of the Province,
I ordered the Secretary of Finance to give an account
of the balance existing in the State Treasury; and it
was verified that up to April 30th last there existed a
sum of Rs. 87,000,000 (&pound;5,800 sterling), which became
reduced to Rs. 50,000,000 (&pound;3,334 sterling) after the
payments made on the 1st, 3rd, and 4th of the present
month (May, 1910). It must be understood that the
above-mentioned sum does not represent a balance
existing in the Treasury, because it includes deposits
and guarantees, as well as the deposits of the Orphan
Asylum and of the Monte Pio.</p>

<p>"Leaving out the sums left in the Treasury on
deposit, and which represent in fact a debt of the State,
we come to the conclusion that there is no money whatever
in the Treasury, and that the State '<i>ainda fica a
dever</i>' (is instead deep in debt). The expenses were vastly
higher than the income of the Province and whereas
the expenses of administration increased daily, the
receipts remained stationary."</p>

<p>There was a certain humour in the Presidente's
remarks on crime, when he referred to the difficulties
experienced by the Chief of Police, who received no
remuneration.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill1-112.jpg"><img src="images/ill1-112_th.jpg" alt="The Author's Six Followers." title="The Author's Six Followers." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">The Author's Six Followers.</p>
<hr />
<p>"It is easy," he said, "to understand the drawbacks
resulting for the maintenance of order and the repression
of crime, which is daily becoming more common&mdash;owing,
no doubt, to the facility of entrance, through our unguarded
boundaries, of persecuted people or fugitives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-113" id="Pg_1-113"></a>[<a href="images/1-113.png">113</a>]</span>
from our neighbouring States, and of the impunity of
criminals due to the benevolence of our juries. The
diminution of our police force in so large a State with
such difficult communications has had the result that
the police force, moved incessantly from one end of
the State to the other, never arrives in time to prevent
crime!</p>

<p>"Many criminals have been prosecuted and are
now safely guarded in prisons, but unhappily the
greater number of criminals are loose all over the State
without fear of being prosecuted, and terrorizing the
population. Bands of gipsies were followed by officers
and soldiers, and their attacks on property and individuals
were prevented.... In the town of Catal&atilde;o
the two armed parties were successfully prevented from
violence and '<i>viessem &aacute;s m&aacute;os</i>' (coming to blows). At
Morrinhos armed citizens in a menacing attitude were
dispersed by the police ... in other localities other
riots or attempts (<i>sic</i>) at disorder were immediately
repressed, and we can now say that the State enjoys
perfect peace, save the municipality of Douro, which is
threatened by bandits from Bahia. They are constantly
springing upon the terrified population of the
municipality and especially of the town.</p>

<p>"... The bandits continue their incursions; murders
follow one another in the entire zone between
Formosa and Barreiros, including Santa Rita and
Campo Largo, the inhabitants of which zone are paralyzed
with terror.... Our commerce with Bahia, as
well as relations between private individuals, is thus
interrupted."</p>

<p>In his message the Presidente wisely and frankly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-114" id="Pg_1-114"></a>[<a href="images/1-114.png">114</a>]</span>
disclosed the difficulty of administering justice under
existing laws, when juries would absolve proved and
confessed murderers wholesale. He endeavoured to
stimulate some sense of honour in the officials in charge
of the various municipalities, where "<i>as rendas em geral
mal applicadas</i>" (the revenue generally misapplied)
found its way into channels through which it was not
intended to pass.</p>

<p>A fervent appeal the Presidente made to prevent
the spread of smallpox. The vaccine which the Government
sent to various points of the State was not used.</p>

<p>Curious, indeed, but perfectly true, were his statements
regarding the police force.</p>

<p>"The officers are zealous and understand their
duty. The policemen, notwithstanding all their defects,
are being instructed and disciplined. The policemen
are in general 'criminals' (<i>morigerados</i>). <i>Ha falta de
armamento, e o existente n&atilde;o &eacute; o melhor.</i> (There is lack
of armament and the existing one is not the best.)
The pay is small ... and the body needs reorganization."</p>

<p>The Academy of Law (<i>Academia de direito</i>) was not
satisfactory and did not answer the purpose for which
it was established.</p>

<p>The Lyceum, with its 105 pupils, gave fair results,
barring the tolerance in examinations, which, however,
did not reach a criminal point (<i>sic</i>). It possessed no
building of its own, and was badly housed in a private
dwelling.</p>

<p>Public instruction was admittedly defective all over
the province. The teachers were almost as ignorant
and illiterate as the people who went to learn&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-115" id="Pg_1-115"></a>[<a href="images/1-115.png">115</a>]</span>
perhaps more so; while the Escola Normal (Normal
School) for women was almost altogether unattended.
The public works were uncared for&mdash;there was not a
single new work of art begun in the State. Nor could
the State boast of a single road or trail or bridge in
fair condition.</p>

<p>The laws on the possession of land would one day
lead to immense difficulties and confusion. The greater
part of the land now occupied was in the hands of
people who had no legal right whatever to it.</p>

<p>The existing laws on mining were equally unsatisfactory,
and the Presidente rightly remarked that
"without facilities and guarantees, capitalists will
never venture upon so risky and problematic an enterprise
as mining in a State so distant and so difficult of
access." He also exhorted the people to re-establish
steam navigation on the Araguaya River, such as existed
in the days of the Empire.</p>

<p>I was told that a launch had actually been purchased
in the United States, but was either waiting at Par&aacute;
for want of an engineer or else had again been sold
owing to the impossibility&mdash;due to lack of money&mdash;of
its being transported in sections over the rapids above
Concei&ccedil;&atilde;o.</p>

<p>The question of boundaries with neighbouring
States was an amusing one. According to some rule
for which no one can account, the Government of Goyaz
claimed from the State of Matto Grosso enormous
stretches of land on the opposite side of its natural,
indisputable geographical western boundary, the main
stream Araguaya, as well as the isolated settlement of
Concei&ccedil;&atilde;o, on the opposite side of the Araguaya River,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-116" id="Pg_1-116"></a>[<a href="images/1-116.png">116</a>]</span>
which was undoubtedly in the State of Par&aacute;. One
only had to glance at a map&mdash;bad as maps were&mdash;to
see that in both cases the claim was an absurd one.
In the case of Concei&ccedil;&atilde;o it was perfectly ridiculous.
The Par&aacute; Government held the place with a military
force and occupied the territory with complete jurisdiction.
In a more peaceful manner the State of Matto
Grosso was in possession of the entire territory west of
the Rio Grande do Araguaya, which the people of
Goyaz said belonged to them. On the west the
Araguaya formed a perfect geographical boundary from
the Southern Goyaz boundary&mdash;where the Araguaya
had its birth&mdash;as far as the most northern point of
the State; whereas, were one to accept the supposed
Goyaz boundary formed by the Rio das Mortes&mdash;a
tributary of lesser volume than the main stream&mdash;it
would involve an imaginary compound boundary line
up the Pared&atilde;o stream, then up the Rio Barreiros, then
an imaginary straight line from north to south across
mountainous country, winding its way east until it
met the Serra dos Bahus, then again north-east over
undetermined country, then along the Rio Apor&eacute; and
eventually joining the Paranahyba River.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, nearly all the Brazilian Government
maps&mdash;and all the foreign ones copied, of course,
from the Brazilian, all remarkable for their inaccuracies&mdash;gave
the wrong boundary as the correct one! In any
case, both the States of Matto Grosso and Par&aacute; were
in actual occupation of the respective disputed territories,
and Goyaz was much too poor to afford fighting
for them, so that I fear her most unreasonable claims
will ever remain unsatisfied.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-117" id="Pg_1-117"></a>[<a href="images/1-117.png">117</a>]</span>
The final blow to the financial status of the Province
was the loan raised on the Banco do Brazil of
Rs. 300,000,000 (&pound;20,000 sterling) at an interest of 7 per
cent per annum. The Presidente counted on the receipts
from the exports as well as on economy in administration
in order to pay the interest on this sum&mdash;a dream
which soon became impossible to realize.</p>

<p>It was then attempted to float an internal loan of
Rs. 200,000,000 (about &pound;13,334 sterling) at an interest of
6 per cent; but, as the Presidente pathetically ended
his message to the State Congress, "not a single person
presented himself to subscribe to the loan."</p>

<p>The receipts from the export of cattle from Goyaz
State amounted in 1910 to only Rs. 171,901,000 (or
&pound;11,460 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> sterling). After all expenses were
deducted the State of Goyaz then showed a deficit of
Rs. 325,510,743 (&pound;21,700 14<i>s.</i> 4<i>d</i>. sterling).</p>

<h2><a name="I_CHAPTER_VIII" id="I_CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Fourteen Long and Weary Days&mdash;Disappointment&mdash;Criminals as
Followers</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was in the town of Goyaz that I had entertained
hopes of finding suitable followers to accompany my
expedition. The officials in Rio de Janeiro had given
me glowing accounts of the bravery of the people
of Goyaz. According to them those settlers of the
interior were all daredevils, courageous beyond words,
and I should have no difficulty whatever in finding
plenty of men who, for a consideration, would join
the expedition.</p>

<p>"They will one and all come with you," a well-known
Colonel had exclaimed enthusiastically to me
in Rio&mdash;"and they will fight like tigers."</p>

<p>I carried the strongest possible&mdash;although somewhat
curiously worded&mdash;credentials from the Federal Government
to the Presidente and other officials of Goyaz,
the letters, which had been handed to me open, stating
that the Presidente was earnestly requested to do all
in his power to help to make the expedition a success.
When I presented these documents, I explained
clearly to the Presidente that all I wished was that
he should help me to collect thirty plucky men, whom
I would naturally pay, and pay well, out of my own
pocket, feed and clothe, during the entire time the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-119" id="Pg_1-119"></a>[<a href="images/1-119.png">119</a>]</span>
expedition lasted, as well as pay all their expenses
back and wages up to the day of reaching their original
point of departure.</p>

<p>"I cannot help you; you will get nobody. Besides,
I have received an official but confidential message
from Rio requesting me to do all I can to prevent your
going on."</p>

<p>Such treachery seemed inconceivable to me, and I
took no notice of it. I again requested the Presidente
to endeavour to find me men and animals, as nothing
would deter me from going on. If no Brazilians came,
I said that I would go alone, but that the value of the
expedition would naturally suffer, as I should thus have
to leave behind all the instruments, cameras, and other
impedimenta, which, single-handed, I could not possibly
carry.</p>

<p>It was my intention to travel north-west from Goyaz
city as far as the River Araguaya. There I wanted to
descend the Araguaya as far as the Tapirapez River&mdash;a
small tributary on the west side of the Araguaya,
shown on some of the very incorrect existing maps
approximately in Lat. 11&deg; S., and on others in Lat. 9&deg;
and some minutes S. Proceeding westward from that
point again, I proposed crossing over to the Xingu
River, then to the Tapajoz, and farther to the Madeira
River. It was necessary for me to hire or purchase a
canoe in order to descend the Araguaya River as far
as the Tapirapez.</p>

<p>Believing that perhaps I might be able to find
men without the assistance of the Governor, I tried
every possible channel in Goyaz. I sent men all round
the town offering high pay. I applied to the com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-120" id="Pg_1-120"></a>[<a href="images/1-120.png">120</a>]</span>manding
officer of the Federal troops. I applied to
the Dominican monks, who have more power in Goyaz
State than all the officials taken together.</p>

<p>The Father Superior of the Dominicans shook his
head at once and told me that, much as he wished to
oblige me, I was asking for something impossible. He
was right. The people were so scared of the Indians,
and of the horrors of camping in the jungle, that no
money in the world would ever induce them to move
out of their town.</p>

<p>"Are there no young fellows in the town who will
come along for the love of adventure as well as the
money they will get?" I asked.</p>

<p>"For love! ... love!" said the friar, bursting
with laughter. "I do not believe that such a thing
exists in Brazil."</p>

<p>Having removed "love or money" from the
programme of temptation, there remained little else
except patience. In the meantime I endeavoured to
hire a canoe. The Presidente kindly undertook to do
this for me with the help of a well-known Colonel,
one of the most revered men in the city.</p>

<p>"There is only one boat on the Araguaya," said the
Presidente to me. "You cannot build a raft, as all
the woods in these regions are too heavy and not one
will float. You must hire that boat or nothing."</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill1-120a.jpg"><img src="images/ill1-120a_th.jpg" alt="View of Goyaz City from Sta. Barbara." title="View of Goyaz City from Sta. Barbara." /></a></p>

<p class="fsc">Author's Men packing Animals.</p>
<hr />
<p>The honoured Colonel his friend also impressed that
point well upon me. "Only that boat or nothing."
They also added that they had arranged for me to hire
that boat for four days, and it would only cost me
&pound;500 sterling. My distinguished friends had taken ten
days to arrange that bargain. It took me ten seconds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-121" id="Pg_1-121"></a>[<a href="images/1-121.png">121</a>]</span>
to disarrange it all. All the more as I had heard that
a German traveller, Dr. Krause, had the previous year
gone down the Araguaya River, where he had done
excellent research work, and had also travelled up the
tributary Tapirapez, crossing over nearly as far as the
Xingu River. He had found in that region no Indians
and the country of little interest. Furthermore, on my
arrival in Goyaz capital I learnt that a Brazilian Government
expedition, under the leadership of Dr. Pimentel,
had already been in Goyaz some six months trying to
start on a journey down the Araguaya, and, if possible,
also to go up the Tapirapez and other tributaries of
that great stream. Moreover, the Araguaya was perhaps,
after the Madeira, one of the best known southern
tributaries of the Amazon. As we have already seen,
during the time of Dom Pedro, the Emperor, there was
even steam navigation almost all along the course of
the upper Araguaya as far as Leopoldina, the port for
Goyaz capital. Several Englishmen and Germans and
very many Brazilians had travelled on that river, where
even military posts had at one time been established
at intervals on its banks.</p>

<p>So that, rather than be imposed upon and travel
for hundreds of kilometres in so well-known a region,
I decided slightly to alter my route in order to cover
ground that was newer and infinitely more interesting
and important.</p>

<p>The Presidente's friend, the highly revered Colonel,
had also undertaken to purchase a number of horses
and mules for me. "The people of Goyaz," said he,
"are terrible thieves; they will swindle you if you
buy them yourself. I will purchase them for you and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-122" id="Pg_1-122"></a>[<a href="images/1-122.png">122</a>]</span>
you will then pay me back the money. By to-morrow
morning," he had stated, "I shall have all the horses
and mules you require."</p>

<p>This was on the day of my arrival in Goyaz. Twelve
days after that date he appeared with a famished,
skeleton-like horse&mdash;only one&mdash;for which he made me
pay nearly double what I had myself paid for other
excellent animals.</p>

<p>I took care after that experience to beware of the
"revered and honest men of Goyaz." Those who
behaved honestly were generally those who were described
as thieves. Everything is reversed in Brazil,
and I should have known better.</p>

<p>Let us have a look around the city. Mules and
horses were grazing in the principal square on a severe
slope; the streets were paved in a fashion calculated
to dislocate your feet or possibly break them if you
happened to be walking out after dark. There was
not the slightest semblance of drainage in any part of
the town. The people flung out into the streets all
that could be flung out, and also a good deal that
should not be flung. The dirt was excessive all over
the place when the rain did not come to the rescue and
wash it all off.</p>

<p>The boast of the town was its brilliant illumination&mdash;one
hundred petroleum lights all told, lighted up
until ten p.m. when there was no moon. When there
was, or should have been, a moon, as on stormy nights,
the municipality economized on the paraffin and the
lamps were not lighted. I do not know anything more
torturing than returning home every night after my
dinner at the palace, walking on the slippery, worn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-123" id="Pg_1-123"></a>[<a href="images/1-123.png">123</a>]</span>
slabs of stone of the pavements, at all angles&mdash;some
were even vertical&mdash;in the middle of the road. You
stumbled, slipped, twisted your feet, jamming them
in the wide interstices between the slabs. I never
could understand why the municipality troubled to
have lights at all. They gave no light when they were
lighted&mdash;not enough to see by them&mdash;and they were
absolutely of no use to the natives themselves. By
eight o'clock p.m. all the people were asleep and barricaded
within their homes.</p>

<p>Yet&mdash;can you believe it?&mdash;in this medi&aelig;val city
you would be talked about considerably and would give
much offence if you went out of your house in clothes
such as you would wear in England in the country.
On Sundays and during all Easter week&mdash;when I was
there&mdash;all the men went out in their frock-coats, top
hats of grotesquely antiquated shapes, extra high
starched collars, and, above all, patent leather shoes&mdash;with
the sun scorching overhead. The women were
amusing enough in their finery&mdash;which had been perhaps
the fashion elsewhere fifty or sixty or more years ago.
But they believed they were as well-dressed and quite as
up-to-date as the smartest women of Paris or London.
They never let an opportunity pass of telling you so.</p>

<p>The most striking building in the principal square
of Goyaz was the prison. I visited it in the company
of the Chief of Police. The place had been specially
cleaned on the occasion of my visit, and that particular
day it looked quite neat. I was shown very
good food which&mdash;at least that day&mdash;had been prepared
for the prisoners. Nearly all the prisoners were murderers.
"But the biggest criminals of all," said the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-124" id="Pg_1-124"></a>[<a href="images/1-124.png">124</a>]</span>
Chief of Police to me, "are not inside this prison;
they are outside!" The poor devils inside were mere
wretches who had not been able to bribe the judges.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, petty theft was considered a shame
in the Province of Goyaz, and was occasionally severely
punished; whereas murderers were usually set free.
I saw a poor negro there who had stolen a handful of
beans and had been sent to five years' penal servitude,
while others who had killed were merely sentenced to
a few months' punishment. In any case, no one in
Brazil can be sentenced to more than thirty years'
detention, no matter how terrible the crime he has
committed.</p>

<p>The display of police guarding the prison was somewhat
excessive. There were fifty policemen to guard
fifty prisoners: policemen standing at each door,
policemen at each corner of the building, while a swarm
of them occupied the front hall. The various common
cells were entered by trap doors in the ceiling, of great
height, and by a ladder which was let down. Thus
escape was rendered improbable, the iron bars of the
elevated windows being sounded every morning and
night for further safety.</p>

<p>The sanitary arrangements were of the most primitive
kind, a mere bucket in a corner serving the needs
of eight or ten men in each chamber.</p>

<p>As there was no lunatic asylum in Goyaz, insane
people were sent to prison and were kept and treated
like criminals.</p>

<p>I noticed several interesting cases of insanity: it
generally took either a religious or a criminal form
in Brazil. One man, with a ghastly degenerate face,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-125" id="Pg_1-125"></a>[<a href="images/1-125.png">125</a>]</span>
and his neck encircled by a heavy iron collar, was
chained to the strong bars of a window. His hands
and feet were also chained. The chain at his neck
was so short that he could only move a few inches away
from the iron bars. He sat crouched like a vicious
dog on the window-ledge, howling and spitting at us
as we passed. His clothes were torn to shreds; his
eyes were sunken and staring, his long, thin, sinewy
arms, with hands which hung as if dead, occasionally
and unconsciously touching this or that near them.
I tried to get close, to talk and examine him; but his
fury was so great against the policeman who accompanied
me that it was impossible to get near. He
was trying to bite like a mad dog, and injured himself
in his efforts to get at us. Another lunatic, too&mdash;loose
in a chamber with other prisoners&mdash;gave a wonderful
exhibition of fury&mdash;that time against me, as he was
under the impression that I had come there to kill
him! He was ready to spring at me when two policemen
seized him and drove him back.</p>

<p>There was a theatre in Goyaz&mdash;a rambling shed of
no artistic pretensions. The heat inside that building
was stifling. When I inquired why there were no
windows to ventilate the place I was told that a leading
Goyaz gentleman, having once travelled to St. Petersburg
in Russia in winter-time, and having seen there
a theatre with no windows, eventually returned to his
native city, and immediately had all the windows of
the theatre walled up, regardless of the fact that what
is suitable in a semi-arctic climate is hardly fit for a
stifling tropical country.</p>

<p>One thing that struck me most in Goyaz was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-126" id="Pg_1-126"></a>[<a href="images/1-126.png">126</a>]</span>
incongruity of the people. With the little literature
which found its way so far in the interior, most of the
men professed advanced social and religious ideas, the
majority making pretence of atheism in a very acute
form. "Down with faith: down with religion: down
with the priests!" was their cry.</p>

<p>Yet, much to my amazement&mdash;I was there in Easter
week&mdash;one evening there was a religious procession
through the town. What did I see? All those fierce
atheists, with bare, penitent heads stooping low,
carrying lighted candles and wooden images of our
crucified Saviour and the Virgin! The procession was
extremely picturesque, the entire population, dressed
up for the occasion, being out in the streets that night,
while all the men, including the policemen and federal
soldiers&mdash;all bareheaded&mdash;walked meekly along in the
procession, each carrying a candle. When the procession
arrived at the church, the Presidente himself&mdash;another
atheist&mdash;respectfully attended the service; then
the priest came out and delivered a spirited sermon
to the assembled crowds in the square. Then you saw
those atheists&mdash;old and young, civil and military&mdash;again
kneeling on the hard and irregular paving-stones&mdash;some
had taken the precaution to spread their handkerchiefs
so as not to soil their trousers&mdash;and beating
their chests and murmuring prayers, and shaking their
heads in sign of repentance.</p>

<p>Such is the world! The prettiest part of the procession
was that formed by the young girls, all garbed
in immaculate white, and with jet-black hair&mdash;masses
of it&mdash;hanging loose upon their shoulders. The chanting
was musical and the whole affair most impressive.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-127" id="Pg_1-127"></a>[<a href="images/1-127.png">127</a>]</span>
I had received somewhat of a shock in the morning
on passing the principal church&mdash;there were five or
six in Goyaz. Spread out upon the pavement was the
life-size wooden figure of our Saviour&mdash;which had
evidently long been stored in a damp cellar&mdash;much
mildewed and left there in the sun in preparation for
the evening performance. The red wig of real hair,
with its crown of thorns, had been removed and was
drying upon a convenient neighbouring shrub! Really,
those people of Goyaz were an amusing mixture of
simplicity and superstition.</p>

<p>One great redeeming point of the people of Goyaz
was that they were extremely charitable. They had
erected a huge building as a workhouse. It was entirely
supported by charity. A small library had also been
established.</p>

<p>As I have elsewhere stated, I needed for my expedition
no less than thirty men, so that they could, if
necessary, carry all my instruments, cameras, provisions,
ammunition, etc., where animals could not get through.</p>

<p>Fourteen long and tedious days elapsed in Goyaz.
No one could be induced to come. In despair I sent
a despatch to the Minister of Agriculture, asking for
the loan of at least four soldiers&mdash;whom I should naturally
have paid out of my own pocket, as I had duly
explained to the Presidente, who backed my request.
To my regret I received a reply from the Minister of
War saying that at that moment the Government
could not possibly spare four soldiers. It must be
said that, although the men of Goyaz did not shine
for their bravery, it was not so with the ladies, several
of whom offered, if necessary, to accompany the ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-128" id="Pg_1-128"></a>[<a href="images/1-128.png">128</a>]</span>pedition
and do, of course, the work of the men. I
believe that they meant it.</p>

<p>I have, indeed, the greatest respect and admiration for
the noble self-sacrifice of the women of Goyaz. Devoted
mothers and wives, to men who deserved no devotion
at all&mdash;nearly all the men had concubines&mdash;gentle,
humble, thoughtful, simple and hard-working, they
did all the work in the house. They were a great
contrast to the lazy, conceited, vain male portion of
the population. Certainly, in a population of 10,000
people, I met two or three men who deserved respect,
but they were the exception.</p>

<p>If the men were so timid, it was not altogether their
fault; they could not help it. It was enough to look
at them to see that no great feats of bravery could
be expected of them. They were under-developed, exhausted,
eaten up by the most terrible complaint of
the blood. The lives in which they merely vegetated
were without any mental stimulus. Many suffered
from go&icirc;tre, others had chests that were pitiful to look
at, so under-developed were they; all continually
complained, every time you spoke to them, of headache,
toothache, backache, or some other ache. They
were always dissatisfied with life and with the world
at large, and had no energy whatever to try and improve
their condition. They were extremely polite;
they had a conventional code of good manners, to which,
they adhered faithfully&mdash;but that was all.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill1-128.jpg"><img src="images/ill1-128_th.jpg" alt="Some of Author's Pack Animals." title="Some of Author's Pack Animals." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Some of Author's Pack Animals.</p>
<hr />
<p>At the end of the fourteen days in Goyaz I had
been able to purchase a good number of mules and
horses&mdash;at a very high price, as the people would
not otherwise part with their quadrupeds. Also I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-129" id="Pg_1-129"></a>[<a href="images/1-129.png">129</a>]</span>
had collected all the riding and pack saddles and harness
necessary, a sufficient quantity of spare shoes for the
animals, a number of large saws, axes, picks and spades,
large knives for cutting our way through the forest, and
every possible implement necessary on a journey of
the kind I was about to undertake. Everything was
ready&mdash;except the men!</p>

<p>Alcides Ferreiro do Santos and Filippe da Costa de
Britto&mdash;the two men lent me by Mr. Louis Schnoor in
Araguary&mdash;upon seeing my plight were at last induced
to accompany the expedition at a salary of close upon
a pound sterling a day each.</p>

<p>At the last moment the Presidente came to my
rescue. He supplied me with six men.</p>

<p>"They are criminals," he said to me, "and they
will give you no end of trouble"&mdash;a fact fully
demonstrated three hours later that same evening,
when one of them&mdash;an ex-policeman&mdash;disappeared
for ever with a few pounds sterling I had advanced
him in order to purchase clothes. Another fellow
vanished later, carrying away some 40 lb. of coffee,
sugar, knives, and other sundries. So then I had two
criminals less.</p>

<p>I packed my animals, and was about to depart with
the four remaining rascals and the two Araguary men&mdash;six
all told&mdash;when a policeman, sent in haste, called
me to the Palace. The truly good-hearted Presidente
and his charming family were in a great state of mind.
They told me that my men had gone about the town
the previous night drinking, and had confided to friends
that they were merely coming with me in order to
murder and rob me of all I possessed as soon as they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-130" id="Pg_1-130"></a>[<a href="images/1-130.png">130</a>]</span>
had an opportunity. It was an open secret that I
carried a very large sum of money upon my person,
as after leaving S&atilde;o Paulo city it was impossible to
obtain money by cashing cheques on letters of credit
or other such civilized means, and it was imperative
for me to carry several thousand pounds sterling in
cash in order to be able to purchase horses, mules,
boats, food, and pay the men, as long as the journey
should last.</p>

<p>When you stop to consider that I had before me
the prospect of not replenishing my exchequer for at
least one year, or perhaps two years or more, it will
be easily understood that if one wants to travel, and
travel quickly as I do, there is no other possible way
than to carry the money with one in hard cash. The
risk was certainly enormous, although no one except
myself ever really knew the amount that I actually
carried. A large portion of that sum was in Brazilian
notes, a good deal in English bank-notes, and some four
hundred pounds sterling in English gold. As I could
trust nobody, that sum, except what I gradually spent,
and barring the few moments when I took my daily morning
bath, never left my person, even for a few minutes,
for the entire period of one year. Most of the notes
were contained in two bulky leather bags and the gold
in a third, attached firmly to a strong belt which day
and night&mdash;much to my discomfort&mdash;encircled my
waist. The larger bank-notes, letters of credit, etc.,
were divided into my various coat, shirt, and trousers
pockets. The gold was so heavy that it caused with
its friction a large sore on my right hip&mdash;a sore which
remained there more or less for an entire year.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-131" id="Pg_1-131"></a>[<a href="images/1-131.png">131</a>]</span>
"You cannot start under such conditions," said
the Presidente appealingly. "I cannot furnish other
men. No one will go, notwithstanding the high pay
you give them."</p>

<p>I thanked the Presidente for his exquisite kindness,
and for the very generous and thoughtful hospitality
he and his delightful family had offered me in Goyaz,
and which left in my mind the only pleasant moments
spent in that dull city.</p>

<h2><a name="I_CHAPTER_IX" id="I_CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Departure&mdash;Devoured by Insects</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> minutes later I had again joined my caravan,
watched intently, at a respectful distance, by a few
astonished natives of Goyaz. As soon as all my mules and
horses had been packed&mdash;they were very heavily laden&mdash;I
took my departure in a direction north-west by west.
The six men mounted on mules came along. I had armed
all my followers with the best repeating carbines that are
made, as well as with excellent automatic pistols, and
the long daggers locally used; but personally I carried
no weapons of any kind.</p>

<p>Having been unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient men
from the officials of Goyaz, there yet remained for me one
last faint hope. It was to try and get a few followers
from the Indian colony of the Salesian friars, a few
days' journey west of the Araguaya River.</p>

<p>On April 26th, from the height of Santa Barbara
(elev. 2,150 ft. above the sea level), a picturesque
chapel and graveyard to the west of the city, I bade
good-bye for good to Goyaz capital (elev. 1,950 ft.).
One obtained from this point a fine view of the entire
city spreading from north to south, at the bottom of
the imposing frame of mountains on the south with
their extraordinary columnar formation. Each natural<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-133" id="Pg_1-133"></a>[<a href="images/1-133.png">133</a>]</span>
column, with its mineral composition and crystallization,
shone like silver in the bright light. The <i>ensemble</i>
from our point of vantage resembled the set of pipes
of an immense church organ. High hills stood to the
east. In the distance to the south-west the lower
country was open with the exception of mountains in
the far background.</p>

<p>We marched rapidly enough across wooded country
until we crossed the Rio Vermelho (elev. 1,750 ft.).
My men became very excited and began firing their
carbines recklessly. I had handed to them fifty cartridges
each, with strict instructions not to fire without
my orders. I was some distance off. When I heard
the fusillade I immediately galloped to the spot. The
men had blazed away nearly all their ammunition, nor
would they cease firing when I ordered them until
they had exhausted their supply of 300 cartridges in
all. Why were they firing? Because, said they, they
had crossed the first water on their journey.</p>

<p>My heart absolutely sank into my boots when I
realized that it was my fate to travel with such contemptible
imbeciles for perhaps a year longer or more,
and that was only the first day! Oh, what a prospect!
We had our first quarrel when the men demanded to
have their belts replenished with cartridges for their
protection against attack. As I refused to let them
have them there was a mutiny, the men declining to go
on another yard unless the cartridges were handed to
them. We had not been gone more than three hours, and
a mutiny already! With a great deal of patience I induced
them to go on, which they eventually did with oaths
and language somewhat unpleasant. Still I held firm.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-134" id="Pg_1-134"></a>[<a href="images/1-134.png">134</a>]</span>
After several ascents and descents and a great many
mishaps with our mules, unaccustomed yet to the
work, we made camp, having marched 18 kil., on the
bank of the Rio Agapa (elev. 1,650 ft.), near which
the grazing was fair.</p>

<p>Two mules escaped during the night, and we could
only make a late start the next morning. Alcides traced
them all the way back to Goyaz, where he recovered
them. Up and down we went, from 1,760 ft. to
1,550 ft., at which elevation we crossed the Rio Indio
with a beautiful rocky bed the banks of which showed
strata of red and grey clay and delicious crystalline
water. No fossils of any kind were to be seen anywhere,
although I looked hard in search of them all the time.
The country was undulating and fairly thickly wooded
near streams, otherwise it consisted mostly of campos,
at the highest point of which another beautiful panoramic
view of the escarpment in the plateau we had left
behind could be obtained. The elevation was constantly
changing between 1,750 ft. and 2,050 ft. above
the sea level. Burity and other palms were plentiful.
We crossed that day three streams, the last one the
Rio Uva.</p>

<p>In a distance of 38 kil. we saw only a miserable
shed, although we passed a site where a ruined house
and paddock showed that once there must have been
quite an ancient and important farm. Yes, indeed,
Goyaz State had seen better days in the time of the
Emperor and when slavery was legal. With the
present lack of population and the prohibitive prices
of labour it was impossible to carry on farming profitably.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-135" id="Pg_1-135"></a>[<a href="images/1-135.png">135</a>]</span>
The landscape was everywhere beautiful, but one
never saw a bird, never perceived a butterfly, nor any
other animal life of any kind. I was just remarking
this fact to Alcides when a snake, eight or nine feet
long, crossed at a great speed in front of my mule.
The mules and horses were rather frightened at first
of snakes, and it was amusing to watch how high they
stepped when they saw them and tried to escape from
them. We were in great luck. A flock of six beautiful
red <i>araras</i> (macaws) passed above our heads. They
looked perfectly gorgeous as they flapped their wings
heavily and shrieked loudly as they sped along.</p>

<p>The formation of the soil in that region was interesting
enough. Under a greyish white surface layer
there were thin sedimentary strata of pebbles, deposited
evidently by water, then under these a thick stratum&mdash;30
ft. or more&mdash;of warm-coloured red earth. The
streams which had cut their way through this geological
formation were invariably limpid in the extreme.</p>

<p>We were beginning to find beautiful flowers and
butterflies again, the latter in great swarms near the
water.</p>

<p>My caravan of grey and white pack-animals&mdash;some
fourteen&mdash;was quite a picturesque sight as it wound its
way down steep hill-sides, the mounted men urging the
mules with shouts and lashes from their whips. We
experienced difficulty in finding a good camp that night,
the grazing being poor and the water scarce when
sunset came. It seemed a pity that the most suitable
camping places were not always to be found when you
wished to halt!</p>

<p>We were now at an elevation of 1,550 ft. When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-136" id="Pg_1-136"></a>[<a href="images/1-136.png">136</a>]</span>
we proceeded the next morning we found nothing
of interest. Fairly wooded country alternated with
campos, at first rather undulating, then almost flat,
until we arrived at the Tapirapuana River (elev.
1,350 ft.), 8 yards wide and 3 ft. deep, which we crossed
without much trouble, in the afternoon, at a spot some
28 kil. distant from our last camp. Luxuriant foliage
hung over the banks right down into the water, which
flowed so slowly&mdash;only at the rate of 1,080 metres an
hour&mdash;that it looked almost stagnant, and of a muddy,
dirty, greenish colour.</p>

<p>We were much troubled by mosquitoes, flies and
<i>carrapatinhos</i>, the latter a kind of tiny little clinging
parasite which swarmed absolutely all over us every
time we put our feet on the ground on dismounting from
our animals. The irritation was such that you actually
drove your nails into your skin in scratching yourself.
They could only be driven away by smearing oneself
all over with tobacco juice, the local remedy, or with
strong carbolic soap, which I generally used, and which
worked even more satisfactorily.</p>

<p>A tubercular leper came to spend the evening in
our camp. He was most repulsive, with his enlarged
features, especially the nose, of a ghastly, shiny, unwholesome,
greenish white, and pitifully swollen feet
and hands.</p>

<p>The heat was not unbearable in that region&mdash;89&deg;
Fahrenheit in the shade, 105&deg; in the sun. There was a
breeze blowing that day from the north-east, with a
velocity of 200 metres a minute by anemometer.</p>

<p>A good portion of the following day was wasted
trying to recover four animals that had escaped. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-137" id="Pg_1-137"></a>[<a href="images/1-137.png">137</a>]</span>
order that they might graze properly it was necessary
to let them loose. They sometimes strayed away long
distances. Occasionally they hid in the shade of the
<i>matto</i> (forest and shrub), and it was easy to miss them
while looking for them. Luckily, two of my men&mdash;Alcides
and a man called Antonio&mdash;were excellent
trackers, and sooner or later they were generally able
to bring back the animals, which was not at all difficult,
as one only had to follow the marks of their hoofs
to find where they had gone.</p>

<p>We departed late in the afternoon through thick
shrub, over marked undulations&mdash;in some spots quite
steep. From the highest point that day (elev. 1,900 ft.)
we obtained an extensive view of flat tablelands in
the distance to the east, with a low hill-range standing
in front of them. It was scenery quite typical of
Central Brazil, with no irregular, striking mountains;
but everywhere we had plenty to study in the effects
of erosion on that great continent.</p>

<p>I tried to make up for time lost by marching at
night&mdash;a most trying experience, as my men, unaccustomed
to the work and frightened at every shadow,
let the mules stray in all directions. I unfortunately
had to hand over to my followers a few cartridges each,
or else they would not come on. Every now and then
that night they fired recklessly in the dark&mdash;much to
the danger of beasts and men alike&mdash;thinking they had
seen an Indian, or a leopard, or some other wild animal.
I was glad when we arrived in camp and ascertained
that no one had been wounded.</p>

<p>That night-march demoralized animals and men
alike. Most of the animals strayed away during the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-138" id="Pg_1-138"></a>[<a href="images/1-138.png">138</a>]</span>
night, as the grazing was bad where we halted. I was
compelled to halt for two days in that miserable spot,
simply devoured by flies and mosquitoes and <i>carrapatos</i>,
in order to recover them.</p>

<p>If you do not know what a <i>carrapato</i> is, let me tell
you. It is an insect of the order of Diptera and the
genus <i>Mosca pupiparas</i>, and is technically known as
<i>Melophagus ovinus</i>. Its flattened, almost circular
body varies in size from the head of an ordinary nail
to the section of a good-sized pencil. Like the <i>carrapatinho</i>&mdash;its
miniature reproduction&mdash;it possesses wonderful
clinging powers, its legs with hook attachment
actually entering under the skin. Its chief delight
consists in inserting its head right under your cutaneous
tissues, wherefrom it can suck your blood with
convenient ease. It is wonderfully adept at this, and
while I was asleep, occasionally as many as eight or ten
of these brutes were able to settle down comfortably
to their work without my noticing them; and some&mdash;and
it speaks highly for their ability&mdash;were even able
to enter my skin (in covered parts of the body) in the
day-time when I was fully awake, without my detecting
them. I believe that previous to inserting the head
they must inject some poison which deadens the sensitiveness
of the skin. It is only after they have been
at work some hours that a slight itching causes their
detection. Then comes the difficulty of extracting
them. If in a rash moment you seize the carrapato
by the body and pull, its head becomes separated from
its body and remains under your skin, poisoning it
badly and eventually causing unpleasant sores. Having
been taught the proper process of extraction, I, like all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-139" id="Pg_1-139"></a>[<a href="images/1-139.png">139</a>]</span>
my men, carried on my person a large pin. When the
carrapato was duly located&mdash;it is quite easy to see it,
as the large body remains outside&mdash;the pin was duly
pushed right through its body. The carrapato, thus
surprised, at once let go with its clinging legs, which
struggled pitifully in the air. Then with strong tobacco
juice or liquefied carbolic soap, or iodine, you smeared
all round the place where the head was still inserted.
The unpleasantness of these various beverages immediately
persuaded the brute to withdraw its head at
once. You could then triumphantly wave the pin and
struggling carrapato in the air. You were liberated
from the unpleasant visitor. It was not uncommon
while you were extracting one&mdash;the operation took
some little time&mdash;for two or three others to find
their way into your legs or body. I fortunately
possess blood which does not easily get poisoned, and
felt no ill effects from the hundreds of these brutes
which fed on me during the entire journey; but many
people suffer considerably. My men, for instance, had
nasty-looking sores produced by the bites of the carrapato.
The mules and horses were simply swarming
with these insects, which gave them no end of trouble,
especially as they selected the tenderest parts of the
skin in various localities of the body to settle upon.
Where an animal had a sore it would soon be swarming
with carrapatos near its edge. It would then putrefy,
and maggots in hundreds would be produced inside the
wound almost within a few hours.</p>

<p>There was, near by, an old <i>moradoria</i>, a large
patch of <i>muricy</i> trees (<i>Byrsonima</i>), of which various
species exist. These were not unlike small olive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-140" id="Pg_1-140"></a>[<a href="images/1-140.png">140</a>]</span>
trees and produced a small sweet fruit quite good to
eat.</p>

<p>We went for 22 kil. through a forest with beautiful
fan palms over 30 ft. high. There was no animal life.
We crossed three streamlets, the country between
being undulating. Between the last two streams we
came across rock showing through the alluvial deposits.
It was an interesting conglomerate of minute crystals
cemented together by hardened clay, the whole forming
large blocks.</p>

<p>More trouble was in store for us. One of my mules
was seriously injured. Its spine was so badly strained
that it was quite disabled for further work. My cook,
who had a slight attack of indigestion, wished to be
left there to die, and declined to proceed any farther.
With true Brazilian reasoning he wished, nevertheless,
to be paid off before dying. With true English
reasoning I explained to him that money would be of
little use to him in the next world. If he really
intended to die I would certainly not pay him, but
his wages would naturally go on while he was alive,
continued the journey, and did the cooking. He
quickly returned to life, and to his senses.</p>

<p>Really, in the entire experiences of my travels I
have never come across more pitiable specimens of
manhood than those fellows. They absolutely gave me
a sickly feeling that I never lost while they were with
me, for many many months to come. The animals,
too, were almost as bad as the men. They had little
endurance, they had no courage, everything seemed to
affect them. The worst Abyssinian mule, for instance,
was, for equal work, vastly superior to the best Goyaz<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-141" id="Pg_1-141"></a>[<a href="images/1-141.png">141</a>]</span>
mule. It was a useless task to try and train those
animals. On my many previous expeditions I had
been able to win the affection of my animals, and was
able to train them in a few days so that they obeyed
with the perfection of soldiers, but in Brazil, the last day
I had them&mdash;after several months that they had been
with me&mdash;they were just as disobedient and stupid
as on the first day. In fact, they never even seemed
to recognize us again. They had learnt absolutely
nothing, except bad habits. Everything seemed to
frighten them. One mule, for instance, was afraid of
crossing small streams. Its legs invariably began to
quiver on entering the water, and down would go mule
and baggage rolling into the water. All the thrashing
in the world could not make it get up. We had to
drag the brute bodily across the stream, when it would
jump up on its legs again. It was quite futile to try and
prevent that animal collapsing every time it had to go
across water. So that, on approaching any streamlet,
we had to unload it in order at least to prevent the
baggage getting soaked.</p>

<p>The interior of Brazil&mdash;even comparatively near a
city, as we were still to Goyaz&mdash;did not compare in
civilization with the lowest and poorest countries of
Central Asia or Africa. Humble countries like Persia
and Beluchistan or Abyssinia some ten or fifteen years
ago were more advanced than Brazil to-day. They
had good trails on which a regular postal service was
established, there were regular rest-houses on those
trails, and horses or camels could easily be hired and
exchanged at the different stations, so that one could
travel comparatively quickly. It was not so in Brazil.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-142" id="Pg_1-142"></a>[<a href="images/1-142.png">142</a>]</span>
Even if you wished to take a short journey of a few
days from a city, you had to purchase your horses
or your mules, and have the riding and pack saddles
made for you at a high cost.</p>

<p>As we have seen, even in the city of Goyaz itself,
there did not exist a single hotel, nor did we find a
proper rest-house in the 531 kil. between the railway
terminus and Goyaz capital. Nor is there one of
these conveniences west between Goyaz and Cuyaba,
the capital of Matto Grosso. Of course there were no
hotels because nobody travelled, but it can also be
said that many people do not care to travel where
there are no hotels. In so humble and poor a country
as Persia you always could indulge in a delicious bath
in every caravanserai, which you found in the remotest
spots all over the country. In Brazil you have to
resort to the streams, where the moment you remove
your clothes you are absolutely devoured by mosquitoes,
flies and insects of all kinds&mdash;a perfect torture, I can
assure you. Once you were in the water, immersed up
to the mouth, it took a brave man to come out again,
as millions of mosquitoes and flies and gnats circled
angrily and greedily above your head ready for the
attack the moment you came out.</p>

<p>We were travelling all the time at elevations varying
from 1,450 ft. at our last camp to 1,400 ft. at our
present camp, the highest elevation between these two
places being on a rocky hillock about 100 ft. higher
than those altitudes.</p>

<p>Our camp was on a streamlet flowing from south
to north, of milky water containing lime, which made
our tongues and gums smart when we drank it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-143" id="Pg_1-143"></a>[<a href="images/1-143.png">143</a>]</span>
Again on May 3rd we went through forest all the
time, with wonderful palms and many medicinal plants.
Alcides had an extensive knowledge of the curative
qualities of the various plants. Various species of the
<i>Caroba</i> (<i>Bignoniace&aelig;</i>), very beneficial, they say, as a
blood purifier, especially in the worst of terrible complaints,
were plentiful there. Giant nettles, the <i>Ortiga</i>
or <i>Cassausan</i>, as it is locally called, were also frequently
noticeable, especially when we passed too near and
were stung all over by them.</p>

<p>We had risen to 1,200 ft. on the summit of a range
called O Fogo. From it we had another exquisite
view of the mountain range called Bucainha, which
we had left behind to the east. It had a marked
erosion on its north side.</p>

<p>On the west side of the pass we found curious small
domes as well as pillars and other rocks of columnar
formation. We had met during the day many <i>Aricori</i>
palms, which, I was told, produced a sweet fruit
excellent to eat when ripe, in the month of November.</p>

<p>After a steep rocky descent we made our camp.
We halted earlier than usual. I was sitting outside
my tent while my dinner was being cooked. I could
not help smiling at the warlike array which had been
necessary in order to make a start from Goyaz. The
camp was a regular armoury. Beautiful magazine
rifles, now rusty and dirty owing to the carelessness
of the men, were lying about on the ground; revolvers
and automatic pistols stuck half out of their slings on
the men's belts as they walked about the camp; large
knives and daggers had been thrown about, and so had
the huge, heavy, nickel-plated spurs of the men, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-144" id="Pg_1-144"></a>[<a href="images/1-144.png">144</a>]</span>
their gigantic spiked wheels. These wheels were as
much as two inches in diameter and even more. It was
the habit of Brazilians to wear the spurs upside down,
so that when they got off their mounts they had to
remove them or it would have been impossible for them
to walk. Naturally, worn like that, they were much
more effective, and were intended to torment the
animals with greater success.</p>

<p>I reprimanded the men for keeping their weapons
so dirty. One man thereupon sat himself three feet
away from me and proceeded to clean his rifle,
keeping the muzzle pointed constantly at me. On my
suggesting that he might point the weapon in another
direction he roughly replied the usual thing: "There
is nothing to be afraid of, it is not loaded"&mdash;and
he proceeded to pull the trigger, the gun pointed
straight at me, when I leapt up and snatched it
out of his hands. There was a cartridge in the barrel
and several cartridges in the magazine.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill1-144.jpg"><img src="images/ill1-144_th.jpg" alt="Author's Caravan across the Immense Prairies of Matto Grosso." title="Author's Caravan across the Immense Prairies of Matto Grosso." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Author's Caravan across the Immense Prairies of Matto Grosso.</p>
<hr />
<p>During the night the fusillade was constant. It was
enough for the men to hear a leaf fall. Immediately
there was an alarm and the rifles were fired. Once or
twice the bullets came so unpleasantly near me that
I suspected they were intended for me. I thanked
my stars that my men were bad shots. To make sure
of this fact, I one day had a shooting competition.
After that I became quite assured that it was sufficient
to be at the spot where they aimed to consider myself
in absolute safety. It was not so, of course, when they
aimed somewhere else. I did not care to take away
the cartridges from them altogether, as they would have
then imagined that I was afraid of them&mdash;an impres<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-145" id="Pg_1-145"></a>[<a href="images/1-145.png">145</a>]</span>sion
which it would have been fatal to let them entertain
even for a moment. Each man was allowed to
replenish his belt each day to the extent of ten cartridges.</p>

<p>I have elsewhere referred to the absurd pack-saddles
used in Brazil, so heavy and unsteady when going over
rough country, with the underpads so difficult to adjust
that the animals were soon a mass of sores on the back,
the sides of the body, on the chest and tail. I had
other lighter and more sensible saddles, but I had to
discard them as the Brazilians would not hear of
using them, and I gave up in despair of teaching them
how to pack them. I eventually left those saddles
behind.</p>

<p>The riding-saddles, too, were almost as absurd as
the pack-saddles, constructed as they were of innumerable
and useless pieces of wood, iron and leather.
The stirrups were gaudy, and consisted of a regular
shoe of silver or other metal, into which you inserted
the greater part of your foot, or else of a much ornamented
circular ring. The head-piece and bit were
also extremely heavy, clumsy, and highly decorated,
for everything must be made for show if it had to be
used in Brazil.</p>

<p>It was not possible to associate in any way or be
friendly with my men. They were unpleasant beyond
all conception. One could not say a word&mdash;no matter
how kind&mdash;without the prospect of a long argument or
a row. It was quite beyond them to be civil, and,
like all ignorant people, they always imagined that
they could teach others everything&mdash;including good
manners! They were ridiculously courteous to one
another&mdash;a muleteer talking to another always address<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-146" id="Pg_1-146"></a>[<a href="images/1-146.png">146</a>]</span>ing
him as "Sir," and referring to his comrades as his
"colleagues."</p>

<p>We travelled that day nearly altogether over finely
powdered reddish earth of volcanic origin. I had so
far not met with a single fossil, not a shell, not a petrified
bone of any animal, nor, indeed, impressions on rock
of leaves, twigs or other parts of plants. The farther
one went on, the more one had proof that that portion
at least of the American continent had never been
submerged in its entirety.</p>

<p>Some rocks displayed on the surface peculiar perforations
such as would be produced by incessant water
dripping over them, but these were caused, I think, merely
by water falling over them while they were in a molten
state; other rocks were thoroughly polished on the
surface, as if sand or other gritty substance had flowed
with great force over them, mixed with water&mdash;perhaps
during a period of volcanic activity and torrential rains.</p>

<p>Geological research was somewhat difficult for a
passing traveller in that region, for everything was
smothered in vegetation. Only here and there in the
cuts of rivers was I able to judge a little better of the
actual formation of the land.</p>

<p>We camped on the stream Agua Limpa, which duly
deserved its name of "clear water" (elev. 1,470 ft.). It
flowed south. On May 4th, going through forest again
over a hill (elev. 1,650 ft.), we obtained a glorious view
of the immense expanse to the west and to the south-west&mdash;a
great stretch of greenish, long sweeping lines
with a plateau in the background. A somewhat taller
hill rose at one end of it. We then descended to another
deliciously clear river, which deserved as well as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-147" id="Pg_1-147"></a>[<a href="images/1-147.png">147</a>]</span>
previous one the name of Agua Limpa (elev. 1,450 ft.),
but this one flowed north into the Rio Claro. The
land was fine, sparsely wooded all the time, absolutely
flat, but getting slightly undulating beyond that
stream. It seemed wonderful land for agricultural
purposes.</p>

<p>After passing the Indain River, the Bom Successo,
and another stream, all three flowing south, we swerved
more to the north-west, rising up on an elevated spot,
from which we obtained another glorious panorama,
a high Serra to the west, another in the distance to
the east, the two extending almost parallel towards
the south, where the gap in the horizon line between
these ranges was filled by a very distant range showing
a conical peak, and to the west of this another in the
shape of a dome. It was the grandeur of these panoramas
that impressed one most, rather than their
monotonous beauty.</p>

<p>All the outlines of the scenery of Central Brazil
had, so to speak, been worn smooth by the erosive
action of water and wind, so that no fantastically
shaped mountains had yet been encountered, no
landscape which some great commotion had rendered
strangely picturesque. There, only the steady work
of uncountable ages showed itself in a most impressive
way to those who understood. From a striking pictorial
point of view very little remained in one's mind
of those wonderful scenes after one had turned one's
head away, except, perhaps, their immensity and the
deep green tones&mdash;the two salient points of the scenery.</p>

<p>When we had descended from the pass (elev. 1,650
ft.) we came to the Rio Tres de Majo, where a hamlet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-148" id="Pg_1-148"></a>[<a href="images/1-148.png">148</a>]</span>
of three sheds was found. Twenty-eight kilometres
from our last camp we arrived at the Rio Rancheria,
where stood a miserable farm. Both those streams,
at an elevation of 1,300 ft., flowed into the Rio Claro
to the north.</p>

<p>We had the misfortune of halting near the farmhouse,
and suffered tortures from the millions of mosquitoes,
gnats, carrapatos and carrapatinhos which made
that night almost unbearable. I invariably found that
carrapatos and carrapatinhos were more plentiful where
living people or animals were to be found. Near those
dirty farmhouses we were simply swarming all over
with them. My poor animals, owing to the long
marches we had been making, and the terrible pack-saddles,
had sore backs and loins, sore chests. Yet we
could not stop, and the poor things must stand the pain
and strain.</p>

<h2><a name="I_CHAPTER_X" id="I_CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Fishing&mdash;Termites&mdash;The Great Araguaya River</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">An</span> amusing incident happened. A cow chewed up
the coat of one of my men, which was lying on the
ground. In his fury the owner of the coat, on discovering
the misdeed, seized his carbine and fired four
shots at the cow and four at the farmhouse. None of
us could tell where the bullets went. The cow, startled
by the shots, gave a few jumps and kicks, then, absolutely
uninjured, peacefully continued grazing. The
house too remained untouched. Amazing shots my
men were!</p>

<p>Across almost flat country we reached the Rio
Claro&mdash;"the Limpid River" (elev. 1,250 ft. above the
sea level), 200 metres wide, and flowing along a winding
course in a general direction of south-west to north-east.
Wide beaches of sand and fine gravel were to be seen
on the convex or inner curves of its channel. Along
the banks there was luxuriant vegetation, which hung
down and dipped into the water.</p>

<p>Diamonds were to be found in that river. At low
water curious eruptive, highly ferruginous rocks showed
in the river bed, some in the shape of spherical balls
riddled with perforations, as if they had been in a state
of ebullition, others as little pellets of yellow lava, such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-150" id="Pg_1-150"></a>[<a href="images/1-150.png">150</a>]</span>
as I had before encountered between Araguary and
Goyaz, and which suggested the spluttering of molten
rock suddenly cooled by contact with cold air or water.</p>

<p>We encamped some three kilometres from the Rio
Claro, on the streamlet Arejado, where again we were
devoured by mosquitoes. Although we all had thick
mosquito nets, and although we slept wrapped&mdash;head
and all&mdash;in our respective blankets, the brutes managed
to find their way in and stung us with incredible vigour.
We were fresh blood for them. The irritation caused
by their bites was a torment.</p>

<p>We were now getting closer to the country where
we were to meet the terrible wild Indians, the most
ferocious and cruel cannibals on earth, according to
the accounts heard in Goyaz. My men were already
beginning to lose heart. With the sleepless night due
to the mosquitoes, and the heavy atmosphere caused
by a fast-approaching thunderstorm, they were morose
in the morning. With the exception of Alcides and
the negro Filippe, the others came insolently forward
and refused to go any farther. They shoved the
muzzles of their rifles under my nose; they wished
to be paid up instantly and go back. With a little
patience it was easy to get out of difficulties of that
sort, if you possessed the gift of keeping calm.</p>

<p>Faithful Alcides, who had a fiery temper, seized
his rifle and was about to fire at them, when I took
the weapon from him.</p>

<p>"Do not shoot them, Alcides: these men have
been good (<i>sic</i>) until now because they were in good
health. They are bad now because they are ill. I
will cure them."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-151" id="Pg_1-151"></a>[<a href="images/1-151.png">151</a>]</span>
And so saying I felt the pulse and forehead of the
astonished rioters.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, these men are very, very ill. They
need medicine. Alcides, get the castor oil&mdash;the large
tin."</p>

<p>I had two kinds of castor oil: one tasteless&mdash;<i>pour
fa&ccedil;on de parler</i>&mdash;for my own use and cases of serious
illness; another in large tins, of the commonest kind,
with an odour that would kill an ox, which I used occasionally
for punishment on my men when they were
disobedient.</p>

<p>Alcides, who quickly entered into the spirit of that
little joke, immediately produced the deadly tin, collecting
upon the ground the four cups belonging to the
strikers. Taking my instructions, he poured some four
ounces of the sickening oil into each cup&mdash;and perhaps
a little more. I handed a cup to each man and saw
that he drank it. They all eventually did so, with
comic grimaces and oaths. The men, I must tell you,
had great faith in my powers as a medicine man. Once
or twice before I had already cured them of insignificant
ailments, and whenever I told them seriously that they
were ill they believed, in their ignorance, that they
were really ill.</p>

<p>This done, and to put them again in a good temper,
I patted them on the back and, handing each of them
a fish-hook and a line, sent them all to fish in the river,
saying that as they were so ill I would delay my departure
until the afternoon.</p>

<p>"That pool, over there," some three hundred yards
distant, I suggested would be an excellent place for them
to fish in. In that direction, as meek as lambs, like so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-152" id="Pg_1-152"></a>[<a href="images/1-152.png">152</a>]</span>
many naughty children they all went, carrying the lines
away and some <i>toucinho</i> (lard) for bait. Alcides, who
was an enthusiastic fisherman, also went off with a
line, and had good sport. He reported that the other
men lay flat upon their backs most of the time, groaning
and moaning, upon the rocks, basking in the sun
instead of fishing. The castor oil in any case had the
desired effect that the men did not mutiny again for
some time.</p>

<p>We did not leave camp until 2 p.m. The country
was teeming with plants of great medicinal value, such
as the <i>sucupira</i>, which gave a bean much used in Goyaz
to relieve stomach troubles; the <i>algudanzinho</i>, with
its lovely cadmium-yellow cup-shaped flower&mdash;a plant
which was most plentiful in that region, and the root
of which was said to be very beneficial for the worst of
venereal complaints; and also the <i>acaraiba</i>. Many were
the handsome wild flowers we came across, principally
red and yellow; but to my mind they could bear no
comparison with even the ugliest European wild flowers.
They were coarse in shape and crude in colour, and in
their beauty there was the same difference as there
would be between the lovely refined face of an aristocratic
woman and that of a handsome massive peasant
girl.</p>

<p>Water was certainly not lacking in that country.
We crossed the Rio Striminho, then the Rio Stacco
flowing from south-west to north-east into a lagoon
formed by the Rio Claro. We camped on the bank of
the Rio Stacco. The water was delicious.</p>

<p class="fsc">The Araguaya (looking South).</p>
<hr />
<p>The negro Filippe killed a wild boar. My men had
a great time preparing a huge dinner. They absolutely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-153" id="Pg_1-153"></a>[<a href="images/1-153.png">153</a>]</span>
gorged themselves. Personally I never touch pig in any
shape or form, as I cannot get over the idea that its
meat is poisonous for any thoroughly healthy person.
It may, of course, not be so to people who are not absolutely
healthy. The very sight and odour of it make
me quite ill, and I fully share the idea of Mahommedans
that the meat&mdash;certainly of tame pigs&mdash;is most
unclean.</p>

<p>As we went on we had good sport, my men taking
the greatest delight in fishing in the rivers on the banks
of which we halted. The travelling was easy over
flat country. We made short marches for some days,
in order to let the animals recover their lost strength.
In the river Las Almas (elev. 1,250 ft.), 20 metres wide
and 3 ft. deep, flowing north-west, we caught a beautiful
<i>pintado</i> fish&mdash;so called because of its spotted appearance.
That fish possessed a huge flat head, with long
feelers, two on the nose&mdash;at the side of the nostrils,
to be accurate&mdash;two under its lower mandible. The
mouth was enormous in comparison with the total
length of the fish, and could be opened at an extraordinarily
wide angle. Inside were most peculiar teeth
in sets of twos, while the mouth was lined with thousands
of hard, tiny sharp points. The eyes were far back
upon the skull. The bony dome of the palate was
divided in the centre, and a similar separation was to
be observed in the centre of the lower jaw, giving thus
a great flexibility to the interior of the mouth. When
measured, the length of the head was exactly one-third
of the length of the entire fish.</p>

<p>Other fish, too, were caught that day, called
<i>mandib&eacute;</i> or <i>fidalgo</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-154" id="Pg_1-154"></a>[<a href="images/1-154.png">154</a>]</span>
The aspect of the country was gradually changing.
During that day's march we had gone over beautiful
open stretches of grassy land with only a few stunted
trees upon them. <i>Bosquets</i> or tufts of small palms
or other trees were to be seen, raised on small mounds,
showing how the country was gradually wearing itself
down. Nearly each tree was raised on a mound of
grey clay. Some fine specimens of <i>Lexia</i> trees, with
their peculiarly distorted branches, were to be observed.</p>

<p>Those great scavengers of Brazil, the <i>Urubu</i>, of
which two varieties were to be found&mdash;the <i>Urubu
commun</i> (<i>Cathartes atratus</i>) and the <i>Urubu rei</i>
(<i>Cathartes Papa</i>)&mdash;a cross between a vulture and a
crow, were fairly plentiful now that game was more
abundant in the country. They often pierced our ears
with their unmusical shrieks. The <i>urubu</i> belonged to
the vulture family and was found in all tropical South
America. It had black plumage, somewhat shaggy,
with reddish legs and feet, and bluish, almost naked,
head and neck. Like all rapacious birds of its kind, it
lived entirely on dead animals and what refuse it could
find about the country. Near farms these birds were
generally to be seen in great numbers.</p>

<p>We had a delicious breakfast of fish&mdash;really excellent
eating&mdash;which set everybody in a good humour,
and then we proceeded over slight undulations (elev.
1,250 to 1,300 ft.) through forest until we got to the
Ponte Alto (High Bridge) River, so called because...,
there is no bridge whatever there! The Brazilians
are really too delightful in their reasoning; and, mind
you, it is not done with a mischievous sense of the
ludicrous&mdash;indeed no; it is done seriously. The Ponte<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-155" id="Pg_1-155"></a>[<a href="images/1-155.png">155</a>]</span>
Alto stream was, like most of the other watercourses
of that region, wonderfully limpid.</p>

<p>From that point we were in charming open country,
where we could freely breathe the delicious air. Occasionally
we saw some <i>angelin</i> trees (the <i>Angelino
amargoso</i> and <i>Angelino pedra</i>), technically known as
<i>Andira vermifuga</i> M. and <i>Andira spectabilis</i> Sald.</p>

<p>Nearly all the woods we found had a high specific
gravity: the two latter, for instance, 0&middot;984 and 1&middot;052
respectively, and a resistance to crushing of kilos
0&middot;684 and kilos. 0&middot;648.</p>

<p><i>Cacti</i> of great size were numerous. We were now
in a region where termite-hills (ant-hills) were to be seen
in great numbers. They stood from 2 to 3 ft. above
ground, although occasionally some could be seen
nearly double that height. Some of the ant-heaps
were extraordinary in their architecture, and resembled
miniature castles with towers and terraced platforms.
Whether they had been built so by the ants or worn
down to that shape by the pouring rain and wind, was
not so easy to tell.</p>

<p>The more one saw of the termites, the more one
disliked them, for they were the most insidious, destructive
little brutes of that region. They were ugly
in appearance, with their fat white bodies of a dirty
greenish-white colour. Nevertheless one could not
help having great admiration for those little rascals,
which in one night were able to devour the bottom of
stout wooden boxes, and in a few hours damaged saddles,
clothes, shoes, or any article which happened to be
left resting for a little while on the ground. They were
even able to make an entire house tumble down in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-156" id="Pg_1-156"></a>[<a href="images/1-156.png">156</a>]</span>
comparatively short time if the material used in the
construction were wood.</p>

<p>Yes, one hated them; yet, when one knew all
about them, one had to spend hours watching their
doings with a microscope, it was so interesting. They
seemed to have two social classes among them&mdash;the
labouring class and the warriors. To the labourers
was given the heavy task of digging underground
channels, the surplus earth of which was thrown up
with great force through apertures in the soil until
the earth so displaced and amassed formed a high
heap, riddled in its interior by hundreds of channels
and miniature chambers and apartments. To the
warriors&mdash;really more like a kind of perfect police
service&mdash;was entrusted the safety of the colony and
principally the protection of the young. White ants
have many enemies, especially among the larger ants,
which carry on regular wars against them; for although
ants and termites&mdash;commonly called white ants&mdash;have
many points in common, yet they belong to totally
different orders of insects, as can be easily noticed in
their structure and development. The peculiar structure
of the enlarged heads of the warrior termites was
particularly noticeable. Some had a formidable head
provided with tentacles and powerful rodent clippers&mdash;as
well as the peculiar whitish cuirasses in sections of
the body. The workers had more normal shapes, the
head being better proportioned with the body.</p>

<p>It was enough to split one of the heaps and watch
the termites at work to learn a lesson of what devotion
and duty mean. In the many passages overcrowded
with ants&mdash;there was never confusion&mdash;you saw hun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-157" id="Pg_1-157"></a>[<a href="images/1-157.png">157</a>]</span>dreds
of them, either conveying food or building
materials to the various quarters. Some carried
leaves, others carried pieces of wood, seeds, or dead
insects. If one was not strong enough to convey its
load, others came to its assistance&mdash;although they
generally seemed to resent the intrusion of others in
doing their work. I always noticed that when one was
in difficulty and others ran to the rescue there generally
ensued what seemed to be a row, and the new arrivals
hurriedly left&mdash;either disgusted or angry, I could not
tell which by their minute expression.</p>

<p>Then there were extraordinarily fat lady ants,
lying flat upon their backs, and with many attendants
around them doing massage and general nursing with
the greatest possible gentleness and care. If one wanted
to see a great commotion one only had to introduce
into one of the chambers a larger ant of a different
kind. What struck me was that the moment the fray
was over the termites at once&mdash;if perhaps a little more
excitedly&mdash;resumed their work.</p>

<p>What astonished me more than anything was that
they would go on working at all&mdash;as if nothing had
happened&mdash;when I split open one of their dwellings
and many of the channels, which must have been
normally in the dark&mdash;were now exposed to the light.
This made me suspect that their vision was either
missing altogether or was very defective.</p>

<p>Nature is a wonderful organizer. The majority of
termites&mdash;including warriors and workers&mdash;were sexless;
that was perhaps why they were such good workers,
as they had nothing to distract them. The males and
females whose duty was merely to propagate and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-158" id="Pg_1-158"></a>[<a href="images/1-158.png">158</a>]</span>
improve the race were provided temporarily with wings,
so that they could fly away from the colony and disseminate
their love among other winged termites of
other colonies. The relation between different colonies
was friendly. When their task was accomplished and
flight was no more necessary for them, they conveniently
and voluntarily shed their wings, leaving merely a small
section of the wing root attached to the thorax.</p>

<p>The local name for all kinds of termites was <i>cupim</i>,
but technically they are known in the Order of <i>Neoroptera</i>
as <i>Termes album</i>. Another variety of insect, the
<i>Psocus domesticus</i>, was also as destructive as the <i>Termes
album</i>.</p>

<p>We frequently met with plants of <i>caju</i>, or <i>acaju</i> or
<i>acajueiro</i> (<i>Anacardium Occidentale</i> L.) on our course.
They belonged to the <i>Terebinthace&aelig;</i> group. In a preceding
chapter I have already described the red or
yellow delicious fruit of this tree. Then we found other
interesting trees, such as the <i>oleo</i>, the tall and handsome
<i>poinna</i>, and numerous specimens of the small but
good-looking palm <i>pindova</i>.</p>

<p>There were not many flowers in that particular spot,
barring perhaps an occasional cluster of white flowers,
principally <i>bocca de carneiro</i>, said to have properties
refreshing for the blood.</p>

<p>Near a small stream I noticed some lovely, slender,
tall <i>jeguitiba vermelho</i> trees (<i>Couratari estrellensis</i> Raddi),
from 75 to 80 ft. high, with branches and clusters of
deep green healthy leaves at the summit only.</p>

<p>There was a little less monotony in the scenery
before us that day, for to the west stood, over a long,
slightly undulating line, one peculiar conical hill heavily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-159" id="Pg_1-159"></a>[<a href="images/1-159.png">159</a>]</span>
wooded. In pools of stagnant water were lovely water
flowers, and in the neighbourhood of that moisture
many handsome <i>burity</i> palms were prominent in the
landscape.</p>

<p>We had been mounting gently all the time from our
last camp. Early in the afternoon we reached that
magnificent river, the Araguaya, over 200 yards wide,
although something like between 2,500 and 3,000 kil.,
or perhaps more, from its mouth. Its lovely placid
waters, reflecting with the faithfulness of a mirror the
vegetation on the high steep banks as well as the clouds
in the sky, made an effective picture. The dead silence,
disturbed only by the shouts of my men urging the
mules to the water-side, was most impressive, the water
flowing so slowly that it almost looked stagnant.</p>

<p>Not a mountain, not a hill could be perceived,
except one low humble range of hills to the south. It
was on those hills that the great Araguaya had its
birth.</p>

<p>We crossed the great stream&mdash;mules, baggage and
all, on three canoes upon which a platform had been
erected. Once landed on its western bank, we were,
notwithstanding local boundary quarrels, in the immense
State of Matto Grosso, the wildest of Brazil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I seemed</span> to have no luck on that journey. Everything
went wrong all the time. Everything seemed to stand
in my way to prevent my progress. My men were
demoralized, my mules and horses in a pitiable condition.
I called a halt of two or three days in order
that we might shoe the animals again and rearrange the
pack-saddles. We had, of course, a good supply of new
shoes, but the work of shoeing so many animals was hard,
especially as I had to do most of it myself with Alcides
and Filippe, the other men being absolutely useless.
Add to this a stifling temperature of 90&deg; Fahrenheit.</p>

<p class="fsc">Caraja Indian of the Upper Araguaya River.</p>
<hr />
<p>To make things worse there came a downpour, such
as I have seldom seen, and which lasted for two entire
days. That was the dry season too! The house in
which we had put up&mdash;and through the roof of which
we could admire the stars at our ease while in bed&mdash;was
turned into a regular swimming-tank when the
rain came. We had a good deal of trouble to keep our
things dry, propping them up on improvised stands of
stones which we removed from the crumbling walls of
the building. Fortunately, most of my pack-saddle
cases were air- and water-tight, so that the contents
could not be injured. The wind blew with great fury<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-161" id="Pg_1-161"></a>[<a href="images/1-161.png">161</a>]</span>&mdash;at
the rate of 460 metres a minute, to be strictly
accurate.</p>

<p>There was a humble hamlet at Rio Grande or Porto
do Castanho, on the Matto Grosso side, where we had
crossed the Araguaya River. It was the gloomiest
of gloomy places even in glorious weather. Imagine
it on a wet, windy day. The few tiny one-storied
cabins&mdash;they could hardly be called houses&mdash;had got
soaked with the storm, and looked miserable. The
inhabitants were busy baling water from inside their
dwellings. Many tiles of the roofs had been blown
away, and those that remained had grown extra dark
with the moisture, with merely a bluish tinge from the
reflected light of the grey sky upon their shiny surfaces.
The solitary palm tree at the end of the oblong square
looked pitiful, with its long bladed leaves split and
broken by the wind, while the dense foliage along the
river banks was now several tones darker and richer
than we had seen it before.</p>

<p>Under usual circumstances the <i>plaza</i>&mdash;or square&mdash;was
so high above the river that one could not see the
water at all until one went to the edge of the stream,
but during flood the river rose as much as 20 ft. and
occasionally overflowed the greater portion of the
square.</p>

<p>The grass of the square&mdash;a mere field&mdash;alone seemed
happy in the damp. Half dried and an&aelig;mic from the
hot sun, it seemed to be quickly coming back to life
and vigour in those few hours which had rendered us
all miserable. My poor horses and mules, worn and
sore, stood dripping and wretched, with quivering knees,
in the middle of the square&mdash;too miserable to feed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-162" id="Pg_1-162"></a>[<a href="images/1-162.png">162</a>]</span>
only now and then slashing their long wet tails to right
or left to drive away impertinent flies.</p>

<p>With the storm the temperature had suddenly
descended to 75&deg;, and everybody was shivering with
cold after the oppressive heat before the storm.</p>

<p>Upon the half-rotted wooden cross which stood
in front of the church was perched a vulture&mdash;so thin
and shaggy and soaked and motionless that you might
easily have mistaken it for a stuffed bird. It was the
very picture of misery. But everybody was miserable&mdash;one
could not help it. I was, too&mdash;who am not
much given to being depressed.</p>

<p>While marching or camping in the midst of unspoilt
nature, I never felt depressed, no matter what happened,
and was absolutely regardless of climatic conditions;
but in those miserable settlements&mdash;feeble attempts at
civilization&mdash;I must confess that I used to get low-spirited
too, and often thought what an idiot I had been
to leave my happy homes in Florence and in London,
in order to come to these wretched places.</p>

<p>After the attempts at baling out the water had
proved futile&mdash;as there was more coming in than it
was possible to fling out&mdash;the people in resignation
barricaded their doors and windows. Not a soul
was to be seen or heard anywhere. The place was
absolutely dead. Even after the storm was over no
sign of life could be noticed. The people were all
still hiding and trembling in their houses, the comparatively
slight but sudden change in the temperature
bringing upon most of them attacks of strong malarial
fever, which was there prevalent.</p>

<p>At last, splashing her little naked feet along the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-163" id="Pg_1-163"></a>[<a href="images/1-163.png">163</a>]</span>
footpath in the grass&mdash;now changed into a streamlet&mdash;there
approached a little girl with a face as black as
coal. She looked terrified as she approached the window
out of which I was looking. But she overcame her
fright and, prettily stretching out her tiny hand, called
out "<i>Boa tarde!</i>" (Good afternoon). Her father and
mother were ill; would I give her some medicine for
them? Soon after, when the sky had cleared, other
patients came along asking for quinine or any medicine
I could give them. Others wished to have their teeth
pulled out. The Brazilians of the interior had great
trouble with their teeth, which were usually in a state
of decay.</p>

<p>My own men had wrapped themselves up in their
blankets in order to keep warm. They had slept most
of the time. They were too cold and lazy even to get
up to cook and eat their food. None of the houses
possessed a chimney, cooking being done outside; nor,
of course, any sanitary arrangements. Those of my
men who had toothache cried and moaned the whole
night, as might be expected of children aged six of any
other country. I have seldom seen men more sensitive
and frightened at pain or illness.</p>

<p>The main structure at Porto do Castanho (Port of
the Chestnut Tree, because there should be a chestnut
tree there) was the church, a mere barn, which elsewhere
but in central Brazil would not be considered
good enough for storing hay, still less for the worship
of the Almighty. Not that it was used much for the
latter purpose, as there was no priest within several
hundred kilometres. The walls of the church were all
scraped and dirty, the corners chipped off by passing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-164" id="Pg_1-164"></a>[<a href="images/1-164.png">164</a>]</span>
animals. All the passers-by went and wiped their
dirty hands on the walls of the church&mdash;perhaps attracted
by the whitewash, which none of the other
buildings possessed.</p>

<p>The shops&mdash;there were two&mdash;had nothing for sale,
except some locally grown tobacco. In one shop I
found some small iron nails, which were sold at the
equivalent of 6<i>d.</i> each!</p>

<p>May 11th. The drenching rain continued the entire
night, the minimum temperature being 73&deg; Fahrenheit.
My poor animals were in a terrible condition the next
morning through the damp, the sores having become
badly infected. They were in a purulent condition, and
a mass of maggots&mdash;the terrible <i>bishus</i>, which were the
pest of Brazil. So we had the great job of cleaning them
all with a powerful disinfectant as well as washing them
with a decoction of warm <i>barbatim&atilde;o</i> (<i>Stryphnodendron
barbatim&atilde;o</i> M.), a wood with a great resistance to crushing
(K. 1&middot;015) and a specific gravity of 1&middot;275. The
decoction, which was really very beneficial for wounds
and sores of animals, was made with the bark of that
tree warmed in water over a fire. Another decoction
we frequently used was of salt and <i>carrapicho</i> herb, but
this was not quite so effective as the former.</p>

<p>My men killed a magnificent <i>tucano</i>&mdash;a large bird
with climbing, inquisitive habits. It possessed an
enormous yellow bill of singularly light structure, the
point of which was black. The lower part of the bill
was of a brilliant red, and of a similar red was the rib
of the upper part of the bill. The plumage was of a
handsome velvety black on the body and tail&mdash;quite
shiny&mdash;while the chest was of a pure white, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-165" id="Pg_1-165"></a>[<a href="images/1-165.png">165</a>]</span>
under part of the tail of bright vermilion feathers.
White feathers showed at the base of the tail above.</p>

<p>The <i>tucano</i> (<i>Ramphastos</i>) is too well known for me
to describe it fully again. It is found all over tropical
Brazil. There are many different varieties, such as
the <i>Ramphastos vitellinus</i>, <i>Ramphastos ariel</i>, the <i>Ramphastos
Cuvieri</i>, the <i>Pteroglossus Beauharnaisii</i>, or curl-crested
tucano, etc., extremely common, especially
farther north, near the borders of the Amazon.</p>

<p>I was sorry when my men killed this beautiful bird.
I had watched it for some time, with its inquisitive
habits, hopping from branch to branch, peeping its
bill into cavities and examining everything that happened
below by bending its head attentively, now on
one side then on the other. It evidently took intelligent
interest in our doings. My men had gone out to
do their cooking. The bird watched them with the
greatest attention&mdash;with jerky movements not unlike
those of a magpie.</p>

<p>The tucanos have, I believe, been described as
being stupid; but on the contrary I think they are
extremely clever&mdash;quite as clever as many parrots or
macaws. I observed how shrewd that particular bird
was. It would come quite close to us, and examine
with really amazing attention what we were doing as
long as we were not taking any notice of it, but the
moment a man happened to touch a stone or try to
point a rifle at it, it would fly a long distance off,
with shrill yelps, and would not return until it was quite
sure that we were not noticing its presence.</p>

<p>The uses of the enormous bill of the tucano have
often been discussed by ornithologists, many of whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-166" id="Pg_1-166"></a>[<a href="images/1-166.png">166</a>]</span>
believe that the bill is of no use to that bird and Nature
made in this case a mistake and has not yet had time
to rectify it. Scientists frequently allege that Nature
makes mistakes, because many of them have never
really understood Nature. How could they? They
have never been near enough to Nature unspoiled.
Many of them also believe that tucano birds are great
fishers, following the notion that many water birds
have red or yellow bills of large size. That, too, is
another great mistake, for the tucano is eminently a
fruit and nut eater, and of course a feeder on worms and
insects contained in fruit.</p>

<p>The huge bill, attaining the length of six or seven
inches, is toothed at the sides in order to be able to saw
the stems of fruit. The shape and size of the bill,
far from being a mistake of nature, are made so in
order to enable that bird to dig holes into the bark of
trees and to enable it to crush and chew the many
curiously shaped fruits found in certain parts of the
Brazilian forest. Moreover, the bill is also a great
protection to the head in going through the dense
foliage, where thorns are innumerable and alive with
dangerous insects of great size, which can, owing to
the length of its beak, be destroyed at a distance from
the bird's most vital organs.</p>

<p>These birds have received the name <i>tucano</i> from
the noise they make, which resembles "<i>tok-kan</i>" very
sharply pronounced and with a snap at the end of
each syllable.</p>

<p>The tucanos are good climbers, but not good fliers.
In fact, their flight is somewhat clumsy and heavy.
They seldom fly long distances. They spend all their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-167" id="Pg_1-167"></a>[<a href="images/1-167.png">167</a>]</span>
time on the higher branches of trees. They are
generally to be seen alone or in couples, or perhaps
occasionally in flocks of three or four.</p>

<p>What spare moments I had in Castanho&mdash;after the
storm was over&mdash;I spent on the banks of the river
looking at the magnificent stream.</p>

<p>Looking south, a low hill range could be seen
in the distance with a conical summit rising slightly
above the range&mdash;the Serra do Cayapo. It was there,
as I have said, that the great Araguaya had its birth.
It was interesting to note that the head waters of
the Araguaya&mdash;flowing north, of course&mdash;had their
birth within an infinitesimal distance of those of
two such immense rivers as the Inducassu and the
Sucuru, flowing into the Parana, and also near the
somewhat unknown Taquary River flowing into the
Paraguay.</p>

<p>It would be possible&mdash;although perhaps expensive&mdash;by
means of raised artificial lakes and locks actually to
join at least one of these southern great rivers to the
great Araguaya, and thus&mdash;barring some troublesome
rapids&mdash;form a continuous waterway from south to north
across South America, from Buenos Ayres, roughly in
Lat. 34&deg; 5&#8242; south, to Par&aacute; in Lat. 1&deg; 27&#8242; 6&#8243; South.
Imagine a distance by river extending for 33&deg; 37&#8242; 54&#8243;
(or 3,737 kil.) in a straight line&mdash;as the crow flies&mdash;and
not less than double that distance if we include
the constant turns and deviations in the various connected
rivers.</p>

<p>Easier still and less expensive would be to connect
by rail the last two navigable points of those two
streams. That will certainly be done some day, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-168" id="Pg_1-168"></a>[<a href="images/1-168.png">168</a>]</span>
those abandoned regions are eventually populated and
properly developed.</p>

<p>There were some rocky falls just below Porto
Castanho which prevented navigation as far as the place
where we crossed the Araguaya&mdash;otherwise the river
was navigable from those falls as far as Concei&ccedil;&atilde;o.</p>

<p>The formation of the clouds over the great Araguaya
River was peculiar. Great clusters of globular clouds
generally collected in three distinct strata upon a
whitish sky as far as high up upon the sky vault.</p>

<p>Facing north, the country appeared absolutely flat,
and nothing could be seen above the trees as far as
the eye or even a telescope could perceive. In that
direction the stream, 200 yards wide, flowed through a
perfectly straight channel for about one mile.</p>

<p>The fishing in the river was excellent. One night
we caught a lot of fish. One, a huge <i>pirarara</i> weighing
40 lb., then some <i>pirahiba</i> and a <i>pintado</i>, the latter
24 lb. in weight. The <i>pirarara</i> was an extraordinary-looking
fish. It had a long head covered entirely with
a hard, bony, granular substance, which could only be
cracked by a severe blow with an axe. The eyes were
prominent and placed quite close to abnormally long
antenn&aelig; or feelers. The back of the <i>pirarara</i> was
bluish black, the centre of the body longitudinally was
yellowish, whereas the under part was white. The
tail was of a bright vermilion, and the black fins had
red edges, which made the huge <i>pirarara</i> a really beautiful
fish to look at.</p>

<p class="fsc">One Night's Fishing on the Araguaya.</p>
<hr />
<p>The <i>pirahiba</i> had a grey back with stripes so faint
that they were hardly visible. Its head was flat and
anchor-shaped. The eyes&mdash;very small&mdash;were curiously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-169" id="Pg_1-169"></a>[<a href="images/1-169.png">169</a>]</span>
situated on the top of the head instead of at the sides&mdash;owing
to the fact that the head was really so flat that
it had no sides: it was merely a gentle convex curve
from one side of the mouth to the other over the skull.
The <i>pirahiba</i> too, like most fish of those rivers, possessed
long tentacles. Its mouth and fins were slightly tinted
red. It displayed powerful teeth similarly arranged
to those of the <i>pintado</i> fish previously described.</p>

<p>Then we got some <i>tubarao</i> (or <i>Squalus carcharias</i>)&mdash;a
small fish with a long, pointed head like a bird's
beak, of the <i>plagiostomos</i> order, and several <i>mand&#297;</i>&mdash;a small
yellow fish with enormous eyes. The <i>mand&#297;</i>
had remarkable vitality. Seven hours after it had
been caught&mdash;I had no idea the poor thing was still
alive&mdash;it gave several leaps in the air, and when I put
it in a bucket of water it shortly began to swim as if
nothing had happened.</p>

<p>There were only two or three very small dug-outs on
the Araguaya, none of which were capable of carrying
more than one or two people. There was no boat there
large enough to carry all my men and baggage, had I
even at that moment decided to descend that river
instead of proceeding west. I took observations for
latitude and longitude at Porto Castanho, as well as
boiling-point observations with the hypso-metrical apparatus,
the latter in order to get the exact elevation,
and also to keep a check on my several aneroids which I
used on the journey merely for differential observations.</p>

<p>May 9th, 1910. Boiling point, 210&deg; 3 F. Temperature
of the air, 83&deg; F. = 1182 ft. above the sea level.
By Aneroid, 1190 ft.</p>

<p>My mules having had a good rest, I was making ready<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-170" id="Pg_1-170"></a>[<a href="images/1-170.png">170</a>]</span>
to start on May 12th, when one of my men refused
to come any farther. He wished to be paid off and
go. So he received his pay and went. He would
probably end his existence in that filthy little hamlet.
He would never have the energy to return to
Goyaz alone. I was rather glad he had gone, as,
a few nights previously, he had fired at me while
I was asleep. The bullet had actually made a hole
through the canvas of my camp bed. I had fortunately
taken the precaution to alter the position of
my bed&mdash;under my tent&mdash;a precaution I took every
night, after my men had gone to sleep in their hammocks,
some distance outside. The man had evidently
aimed where he thought my head was resting. I having
turned the bed around, the bullet, fired from the man
standing, went just over my ankles, perforating the
canvas quite close to them. I naturally came out of
my tent to see what was the matter, and saw the man
with the rifle in his hand.</p>

<p>"Why did you shoot?" I inquired, as the man,
evidently surprised to see me standing before him,
ejaculated disconnected words.</p>

<p>"I saw a huge <i>on&ccedil;a</i>" (a jaguar) ... "it was
there ... I saw its two eyes shining like fire...."</p>

<p>"Did you kill the <i>on&ccedil;a</i>?"</p>

<p>"No, it leapt away."</p>

<p>I advised the man, patting him paternally on
the back, not to startle everybody again. If he
should see another <i>on&ccedil;a</i> he had better come to me.
I seldom missed when I fired at all&mdash;as I had been
able to show them a few days before. I did not wish
my men to behave like so many timid young girls,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-171" id="Pg_1-171"></a>[<a href="images/1-171.png">171</a>]</span>
as I wished to be able to tell people in Europe that
Brazilians were brave and noble.</p>

<p>"Firing in such a fashion indiscriminately," I explained
to him, "you might have even killed one of
your companions! Now go to sleep like a good fellow,
and do not fire again!"</p>

<p>I spoke to the rascal in the gentlest of ways, never
for one moment letting him suspect that I knew he
had intended that bullet to go through my head. Nor
did I ever take any of the other men into my confidence.
When they asked what the commotion was about, I
told them that their companion had fired at a jaguar
and the jaguar had leapt away. There is only one
effective weapon you can use with scoundrels. It is
the greatest calm and kindness.</p>

<p>The man, hiding his face in his hands, threw himself
upon his hammock and began to sob. He sobbed and
sobbed and sobbed until the morning&mdash;much to the inconvenience
of everybody in camp. At sunrise he had
been seized with a severe attack of rheumatism which
had contracted a leg badly. It was pitiful to see him
walking&mdash;but when he was not aware of being looked
at he walked as well as anybody else.</p>

<p>From that day that fellow never dared look me
straight in the face. He avoided riding near me on
the march, and in camp was sulky and unpleasant,
retiring to a distance and declining to work. He was
relieved of the functions of cook. The last time he had
produced a meal nearly brought massacre upon him at
the hands of the other men.</p>

<p>He received his full pay up to date, without uttering
a word of thanks. He duly signed a receipt with his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-172" id="Pg_1-172"></a>[<a href="images/1-172.png">172</a>]</span>
thumb-mark, as he was unable to write. When the
troop of horses and mules and his companions left, he
never spoke a word of farewell to his companions or
animals, nor to me. He sat silent and motionless, with
his eyes riveted to the ground as if in a trance. Some
days later we discovered that he had stolen from our
store some 40 lbs. of coffee and a large quantity of sugar,
as well as a number of other articles which had been
useful to us.</p>

<p>The sky when we left was overcast, and huge
globular clouds, white and grey, hung in great masses,
especially half way up the vault of the sky. The
country, after crossing the Araguaya, was remarkably
beautiful, from an agricultural point of view&mdash;enormous
campos or prairies&mdash;over rich alluvial deposits, with
scanty stunted trees upon them. Plenty of <i>burity</i> palms
grew in the lower depressions.</p>

<p>My men suffered intensely from the cold at night&mdash;the
minimum being 60&deg; Fahr., maximum 92&deg;, in the
afternoon of the 13th. The temperature had been
much lower since we had crossed the great river. The
elevation was only 1,250 ft.</p>

<p>Rising slowly over an undulation in the country
to 1,300 ft., we began to find igneous rock showing
through the surface soil, especially on the higher points.</p>

<p><i>Lixia</i> (<i>Nephelium Litchi</i> Carab), <i>caraiba</i> and the
<i>laranjeira do campo</i> (<i>Citrus vulgaris</i>), were trees to be
seen in that region.</p>

<p>We had wonderfully clear sky in the morning. At
noon it became slightly clouded, while in the afternoon
one-third of the sky was covered. A light breeze blew
from the west.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-173" id="Pg_1-173"></a>[<a href="images/1-173.png">173</a>]</span>
Some 28 kil. from the Araguaya we came to a small
miserable farmhouse. After a great deal of bargaining
I was able to purchase some extra horses. The people
had no idea whatever of the value of money, and
named sums at first which would have easily purchased
the finest horses on the English turf. They descended
in time to more reasonable figures.</p>

<p>Our life was rendered miserable all day by the
millions of <i>pium</i> or gnats that swarmed around us and
stung us with incredible fierceness and viciousness.
Those little brutes left on our skins black marks fully
as large as themselves wherever they stung us. The
itching was most trying. Those marks remained for
several weeks, and only disappeared when we perforated
them with a needle to let the blood out, or waited long
enough for them to become desiccated and the skin
re-formed.</p>

<p><i>Pium</i> is a word of the Tupi and Tupinamba Indians'
language. Those tiny insects entered your eyes,
leaving behind an odoriferous acid which caused great
irritation of the lids. We removed dozens every
day from our eyes. Fortunately they were easily
extracted. They also dashed into your ears, up your
nose, and, whenever you opened it, inside your mouth.</p>

<p>It was well worth going to Matto Grosso to enjoy
the lovely moonlight nights, only comparable in their
luminous splendour to nights of Central Africa in the
middle of the Sahara desert, and to those on the high
Tibetan plateau in Asia. The light of the moon was
so vivid that one could see almost as well as in the
daytime.</p>

<p>Personally, the crisp cool air (min. 59&deg; Fahr.) made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-174" id="Pg_1-174"></a>[<a href="images/1-174.png">174</a>]</span>
me feel in most excellent health and spirits, but my
men, who had putrid constitutions, were a mass of
aches and pains. Some cried like children the entire
night with toothache, moaning and shrieking like
lunatics when the pain became acute; others got
internal aches, another had cramp in the legs. I must
say that Alcides, with all his faults, was the only one
who always did his work&mdash;not always with common
sense, but he did it&mdash;and, when ill, never gave exhibitions
of pitiful weakness like the others.</p>

<p>Filippe, the negro, who eventually showed himself
to be the bravest Brazilian on that expedition, also
stood the pain more calmly and with manliness. As
I had judged from the first moment I had laid eyes upon
them, those were really the only two men who were any
good at all. "<i>Il bon d&igrave; si vede dal mattino</i>" (A fine
day is seen in the morning), says an ancient and very
true Italian proverb; truer, perhaps, in its philosophy
with individuals than with the weather.</p>

<p>Many of my men's complaints vanished with the
warmth of the sun&mdash;108&deg; Fahr. at 1 p.m., with a
maximum temperature during the day of 85&deg; in the
shade.</p>

<p>With the beautiful clear sky and a gentle breeze
blowing, it was a real delight to march. Only a slight
whitish mist&mdash;always in horizontal streaks&mdash;was to be
noticed near the earth. The sky, although limpid, was
never of a deep blue, but merely of a pale cobalt. The
dew was heavy during the night and soaked everything,
making the baggage, the tents particularly, heavy for
the animals to carry. We still kept at an elevation
of 1,250 ft., noticing, as we marched on, an isolated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-175" id="Pg_1-175"></a>[<a href="images/1-175.png">175</a>]</span>
range of hills extending from north-east to south-west
and showing considerable erosion at its south-westerly
terminus. Two conical hills&mdash;one a broken cone&mdash;stood
on the summit of a flat plateau, the entire range,
as well as the summit of hills, showing eroded slopes
with vertical wall-like superior portions.</p>

<p>After leaving the stream at the foot of a range
1,450 ft. above the sea level, on rising over a low pass
I could observe to the north-east of that range great
blocks of eruptive rock much perforated, in which were
embedded pellets of yellow lava and of red and black
baked igneous rock. On examining the north-eastern
end of the main part of the range it was apparent that
what remained standing before us was merely one half
of a circular crater, the other half of which had collapsed
or had been blown up by volcanic action. The bottom
of the crater was subsequently filled with alluvial
deposits. There was there a grassy plain with a few
<i>burity</i> palms. In the valley before us was ideal pasture
land, which will some day be of great value.</p>

<p>We crossed two cols (elev. 1,550 ft.) with a beautiful
plain between. Then we descended into a third lovely
valley on the north side of the outer wall of the crater.
The grazing was perfect for the animals. Clusters of
vigorous, healthy <i>burity</i> palms stood in great numbers
in the centre and at the sides of the valley. This
great valley was bounded by two ridges extending in
a northerly direction&mdash;two spurs, as it were. The
rounded, channelled outer sides of the crater to the
north would tend to strengthen the theory that those
slopes were formerly a gradual continuation of the
present inclined valley. On those slopes of the moun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-176" id="Pg_1-176"></a>[<a href="images/1-176.png">176</a>]</span>tain
hardly any vegetation could be noticed, perhaps
owing to the fact that hard volcanic rock existed under
the thin surface padding of yellowish earth.</p>

<p>The valley was buried in red and grey lapilli and
ashes, finely broken up marble cubes, and fragments
of other forms of crystallized rock.</p>

<p>As we proceeded from camp Fogasso, the northern
slopes of the crater became divided into huge furrows,
the vertical upper part of the crater displaying vividly
rich red tones. The crater was castellated at the summit,
like the walls of a fortress.</p>

<p>The geological formation of that portion of the
Matto Grosso plateau interested me greatly. Each
individual spur, taken separately, showed slopes sometimes
abrupt, sometimes well rounded, separated from
the next spur of hills by a <b>V</b>-shaped or angular, or
else a concave hollow. At the bottom of those hollows
one did not find the slopes continuing the line of the
crater, but the valley was there absolutely flat and
cut the line of the slope sharply. It would almost
appear as if a subsidence of the soil had taken place
in that particular locality, or else one might speculate
whether those abrupt hills had not been the walls of
what was once a subterranean volcanic cauldron&mdash;the
flat valley, in which we were, having been the
bottom of that cauldron. What little rock one found
in the river bed in this valley showed signs of having
been exposed to intense and prolonged heat, and so
did the brilliant red summit of the hill range, which
was also of the deep red typical of hard-baked rock.</p>

<p>The scene which I had before me there in Matto
Grosso greatly reminded me of a similar basin I had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-177" id="Pg_1-177"></a>[<a href="images/1-177.png">177</a>]</span>
seen when the great Bandaisan mountain in Japan was
blown up by a volcanic explosion and left merely the
bottom part of its gigantic internal cauldron with
vertical red walls around it. With the exception of
scanty and an&aelig;mic grass and a few stunted trees, there
was hardly any vegetation noticeable. The Fogasso
stream, on the bank of which we camped, flowed in an
easterly direction into the Araguaya.</p>

<p>The temperature on the plateau was ideal&mdash;min.
63&deg; Fahr. during the night; max. 75&deg;. We were at
an elevation of 1,450 ft.</p>

<p>On May 15th we were travelling along a valley
over which must have once risen the continuation of
a range which stood to the north of us. There were
deep grooves and corrugations in the valley in a
direction from south to north between the two sections
of the now interrupted range. There we found soil of
red, brown and yellow tints, or else great stretches of
grey volcanic ashes and earth mixed, as well as sharply
angular fragments of igneous rock, which showed that
they had not travelled there by rolling on the ground
or propelled by water.</p>

<p>After this we passed close to another curious spur
of mountains on the east&mdash;quite isolated and of a red
vertical columnar formation. Its summit was broken
up&mdash;much more so than that of the plateau-like range
to the south of us which we were following in a parallel
line. The highest point of that range, to the south, was
wooded, and so were the two conical-topped hills which
towered over it. The strata where exposed showed a
slight dip to the north. We crossed the range by two
low cols at elevations of 1,550 ft. and 1,560 ft. respec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-178" id="Pg_1-178"></a>[<a href="images/1-178.png">178</a>]</span>tively.
On the summit and even lower upon the sides
of those cols we found huge boulders of eruptive rock,
highly ferruginous. Globular lumps, big and small,
of spattered smooth-surfaced yellow lava were to be
found in myriads; also many spherical pellets of
ferruginous, highly-baked rock with innumerable holes
produced while in a state of ebullition. Some of the
ferruginous rocks had pellets of yellow lava firmly
imbedded in them, which had evidently penetrated
while liquid into the hollows of the ferruginous rock
which was already in a semi-solid, or perhaps solidified,
condition. At any rate, when it happened the ferruginous
rock was already harder than the lava.</p>

<p>While I was studying attentively the geological
conditions of that region, the sky suddenly became as
black as ink to the south, and a heavy shower, which
lasted half an hour, drenched us all to the marrow of
our bones. Then it cleared up, and the sun, supplemented
by our natural heat, dried our clothes upon
us again as we went on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> stars were of extraordinary brilliancy at night;
so much so that one could see quite well enough by
their light to get about. The atmosphere being
extremely clear, they appeared of immense size, the
planets shining with dazzling, changing colours which
would have filled even the most profane with reverence
for their splendour.</p>

<p>I drew the attention of my men to the wonderful
sight.</p>

<p>"They are stars!" they replied contemptuously;
"Have you never seen stars before?"</p>

<p>It was indeed difficult to enter into conversation
on any subject with them without having an ardent
desire to strangle the lot, they were so ignorantly
offensive. I was thankful I had the sense always to
go about unarmed, or I am certain some of them would
have paid somewhat dearly for their impertinence. I
was glad, too, that I never felt the weight of loneliness,
as days and days would go by without my saying a
word to them, barring perhaps a shout in camp to
bring my breakfast, lunch, or dinner.</p>

<p>What was even worse than entering into conversation
with them was to listen&mdash;one could not help it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-180" id="Pg_1-180"></a>[<a href="images/1-180.png">180</a>]</span>
they shouted so loudly all the time&mdash;to the conversation
among themselves. We will not refer to the
choice language they used, so inexplicably sacrilegious
and indecorous that it would have set on edge the
teeth of the coarsest specimens of humanity; but the
subject&mdash;I say subject in the singular, mark you, for
alas! there was only one subject&mdash;discussed in all its
phases perhaps, but only one single subject&mdash;assassination.
The accounts of different murders, in some
of which the men boasted they had taken part,
were nightly repeated in their minutest details to the
assembled crowd&mdash;myself excluded&mdash;sitting around the
fire, while the <i>feij&atilde;o</i>&mdash;beans, so loved by them&mdash;were
being stewed for hours and hours in a cauldron.</p>

<p>There was the story of one murder of which one of
the men was particularly proud, in which he reproduced
the facial expression as well as the smothered
shrieks of the horrified victim. He gave a vivid
description of how the blood squirted out like a fountain
from the jugular vein of the throat as it was being
severed. That story&mdash;most graphically narrated, I
admit&mdash;had taken the fancy of that cruel crowd. Almost
every evening, during the entire time those men were
with me, many long months, I heard that story repeated
amid roars of laughter from the company. Murder&mdash;when
applied to others&mdash;was evidently for them a
great joke!</p>

<p>Inconsiderate to a degree, they would get up and
sing at the top of their voices in the middle of the night
and keep everybody awake while the <i>feij&atilde;o</i> was stewing.
It took hours and hours before those awful black beans
had boiled sufficiently to be edible, and the man who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-181" id="Pg_1-181"></a>[<a href="images/1-181.png">181</a>]</span>
acted as cook had to sit up the whole night to stir them
up and watch them. Yes, the position of cook for the
camp was not an enviable one, for it meant marching
all day and sitting up all night to prepare the <i>feij&atilde;o</i>
for the following day. Yet the love they had for their
<i>feij&atilde;o</i>&mdash;I never ate the beastly stuff myself&mdash;was so
great that those lazy devils, who could not be induced
on any account to do other work, did not mind at all
having sleepless nights to watch over the stewing
cauldron. With the <i>feij&atilde;o</i> were placed in the pot large
pieces of <i>toucinho</i> (lard). We carried quantities of
<i>feij&atilde;o</i>, for without <i>feij&atilde;o</i> you cannot induce a
Brazilian to do anything or go anywhere. Of the two he would
rather sacrifice his life than lose his daily <i>feij&atilde;o</i>.</p>

<p>It requires great ability, I believe, to cook <i>feij&atilde;o</i>
properly. I noticed that all my men in a body were
ever superintending its preparation. When the cook
in the early hours of the morning happened to let the
fire go down, or in his drowsiness was not stirring it
properly, there were angry shouts from the other
men, who, every time they opened one eye in their
sleep, invariably gazed towards the beloved cooking-pot.</p>

<p>We came to a second range parallel with the one
described before and extending from north-east to
south-west. Again a vertical natural wall was noticeable
to the east. This range was subdivided into
many sections, almost all of the same size and shape.
The end section to the north-east&mdash;which made an
exception&mdash;was about three and a half times the length
of any of the others. I observed some deep vertical
vents such as are frequently to be seen in the sections<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-182" id="Pg_1-182"></a>[<a href="images/1-182.png">182</a>]</span>
of volcanoes that have partly been blown up. These
vents were particularly numerous in the north-easterly
block, where broad corrugations and some narrow ones&mdash;ten
in all&mdash;were also to be seen.</p>

<p>Two alternatives could explain the present configuration
of that region. There had been either a
great volcanic explosion or else a sudden subsidence.
Personally I was inclined to favour the first hypothesis.
I shall explain why. First because the great fissures
between the various huge blocks and the grooves carved
in those rocks would then at once explain themselves&mdash;caused
naturally by the violent shock. They had
apparently been enlarged in the course of time by
erosion of water and wind, and possibly by the friction
of the d&eacute;bris of the masses of rock settling down when
the stratum was severed. The quantity of d&eacute;bris
of shattered rock minutely broken into cubes and
other angular forms would suggest that some great
shock had occurred. Then the usual yellow pellets
of polished lava, either globular or pear-shaped, or
like an elongated oval ending in a point and well
rounded at the other end, would also indicate that these
missiles had been flying great distances through the
air in a molten state before they had actually dropped.
In fact, the flight was so long as absolutely to cool and
solidify them before they fell&mdash;unless they had fallen
in cold water&mdash;for they had retained their original
form, instead of getting flattened at the heavier end,
as could be expected had the lava reached the ground
in a half-soft state. Large blocks of lava&mdash;which
naturally took a longer time to cool and a shorter time
to reach the earth after their flight through the atmos<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-183" id="Pg_1-183"></a>[<a href="images/1-183.png">183</a>]</span>phere&mdash;had,
in fact, become flattened on the lower side
where they struck the ground. Others of a composite
globular form had invariably been flattened into a
slight curve on the side where they had come in contact
with the soil.</p>

<p>Ovoid rocks as large as a loaf of bread and
composed of compressed cinders were to be seen
about, which, when easily split open, showed a band
of slightly ferruginous matter, very brittle, in a
crystallized condition. In the centre of these rocks
were invariably found beautiful crystals of great
limpidity, easily separated from one another by a
slight pressure of the fingers.</p>

<p>Erosion had evidently since played great part in
the present appearance of the country, but to my
mind&mdash;directly above what is now a valley&mdash;there
existed at one time a high range of mountains, which
was in those days the great dividing line of the waters
flowing south and north.</p>

<p>One might, of course, also argue that what are the
mountains now have been pushed up from underneath
above the ground into their present position, but local
conditions do not tend to encourage this theory.</p>

<p>The strata of red baked rock in the existing mountain
side were almost absolutely horizontal, with merely
a slight dip to the north. In the northern end of the
range the rock showing through the vegetation was
white, as if it had been subjected to baking. The
western aspect of the first range showed also a vertical
summit of red rock with a sloping spur extending
to the west.</p>

<p>We camped that night on the river Prata, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-184" id="Pg_1-184"></a>[<a href="images/1-184.png">184</a>]</span>
flowed south. Elevation, 1,300 ft. Maximum temperature
85&deg; F., minimum 63&frac12;&deg; F.</p>

<p>The formation of the clouds was always interesting.
The long horizontal streaks across the sky, which were
daily noticeable, took a form that day not unlike the
vertebr&aelig; of an immense snake, whereas the higher
clouds of transparent mist in filaments looked exactly
like a huge spider's web.</p>

<p>We established our camp under a tall, handsome,
slender <i>Xinghi</i>-tree, the triangular fruit of which, with
a light brown, hard skin, was deadly poisonous if eaten.
Alcides told me that in Minas Geraes it was much used
in the manufacture of soap. This tree was extremely
neat-looking, with its clean sinuous branches and its
pretty, light green, healthy leaves, of an elongated oval
shape.</p>

<p class="fsc">Peculiar Formation of Central Plateau.</p>
<hr />
<p>My men had insisted on bringing dogs away with
us for safety in case of attack by Indians. They had
in fact procured three&mdash;I would not care to say how&mdash;before
our departure from the Goyaz Province.
Those dogs were just as faithless and lazy and worthless
as the people. They followed us because they
got plenty of food, otherwise they had no affection for
anybody; and, far from giving an alarm when any
person or any animal approached the camp, they were
quite unmoved by anything that happened around
them during the day or night, except at meal-times.
A handsome <i>on&ccedil;a</i> (jaguar) leapt close to camp, and on
perceiving us bounded gracefully away&mdash;the dogs remaining
fast asleep with their noses resting on their
respective extended fore-paws. Another day during
the march a <i>veado</i> (<i>Cervus elaphus</i>), a deer, sprang in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-185" id="Pg_1-185"></a>[<a href="images/1-185.png">185</a>]</span>
flight clean over one of the dogs without the dog even
noticing him! Game was plentiful in that part of
the country, and the animals were so unaccustomed
to see people, that one could get quite near them.</p>

<p>My men went after game in the morning and we did
not make an early start, in fact not until 10.30 a.m.
It was amazing to see the amount of good water that
was to be found on the plateau. We crossed a streamlet
flowing south (elev. 1,300 ft.), and shortly afterwards,
upon gently inclined land, we crossed another stream,
also flowing south.</p>

<p>We were travelling due west along the foot of a
curious range which stood to our north and of another
of similar characteristics to the south. It seemed
quite possible, in fact, even probable, that the two
ranges were formerly only one, which had then split,
and that we were travelling inside the partially-filled-up
fissure between the two divided ranges. The sky-line
of the two ranges matched exactly on both sides&mdash;first
a long hump, then two smaller humps, after
that a more even and continuous line.</p>

<p>On reaching an elevation of 1,500 ft. we were confronted
with a splendid view of a flat plateau to the
west. By a steep descent we went down 300 ft. to
a river (elev. 1,200 ft. above the sea level) in a hollow,
reached by going through dense tall grass and thick
vegetation. A humble wooden cross by the stream
marked the spot where a Brazilian had been murdered
by Indians.</p>

<p>Interesting flows and domes of lava were to be seen
near the stream, after which our marching that day
was mostly up and down campos with magnificent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-186" id="Pg_1-186"></a>[<a href="images/1-186.png">186</a>]</span>
grazing, the general slope of which was from north to
south. At an elevation of 1,400 ft., on turning our
heads back, we had a general view of the two ranges
which had become separated.</p>

<p>On one side of the range, a sloping back was noticeable,
whereas on the opposite side were almost vertical
sides, much grooved, with a terrace about two-thirds
up the total elevation, except at the western end, where
the terrace was instead exactly half way up, with a
minor terrace near the summit.</p>

<p>We met and crossed another streamlet, and then
rose on our route to 1,550 ft., from where another
beautiful view of the plateau to the south-west could
be obtained, a low hill range with a higher peak in
front of it, and the immense green campos at a slanting
angle. Another fine panoramic view of the two divided
ranges was also before us, although from that particular
point of vantage it was slightly more difficult to
reconstruct their former appearance in one's imagination
than from the centre of the valley we had crossed,
although even from that point the fact was apparent
with a little study.</p>

<p>On proceeding down to the river we met some flows
of red lava and, upon the top of nearly every undulation,
boulders of black eruptive rock showed through, highly
ferruginous, as well as much lava in pellets. D&eacute;bris of
baked red and black rock were to be found in quantities
down the slopes and at the bottom of those undulations,
carried there evidently by water. In one or two places,
such as near the river at Ponte Keimada, I smashed
some of the larger boulders of yellow lava. Here is
what I found inside: Under an outer coating of lava<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-187" id="Pg_1-187"></a>[<a href="images/1-187.png">187</a>]</span>
an inch thick there was a layer of solidified cinders.
Under that lay a thin layer of lava, then again yet another
layer of grey ashes, then lava again. This would
indicate that those boulders had gradually reached
their present shape partly in revolutions through
the air thick with cinders, partly by rolling down or
along intermittent stretches of molten lava and cinders
during a great eruption, or perhaps during several
successive eruptions. Personally, I think that it was
during various periods of one eruption before the lava
had cooled, so that in its sticky state it would easily
collect the ashes round it, which it would certainly not
do in its polished, solidified state.</p>

<p>When we had passed beyond the western end of the
two parallel ranges a great change was noticeable in
the appearance of the country we were crossing. We
missed the long, sweeping, uninterrupted lines of the
scenery, and had before our eyes a confused surface
of bosses, mounds and short undulations, with thick
luxuriant vegetation upon them which prevented my
studying carefully their geological formation. The
soil, of a rich red colour, showed every indication of
being extremely fertile in that particular climate.</p>

<p>From the point where we stood, one could well
judge the effects of the great volcanic explosion on the
back of the range&mdash;the one to our left&mdash;where a long
line of buttresses had formed, as if on that side a
subsidence on a large scale had also taken place. It was
in any case curious to notice that at the two termini
east and west of the two parallel ranges white rock
in columnar form was exposed in both ranges in corresponding
sites.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-188" id="Pg_1-188"></a>[<a href="images/1-188.png">188</a>]</span>
The slope noticeable on the north side of the
southern range could be explained by the tilting of the
strata where the separation took place. The angle of
the strata clearly demonstrated this fact.</p>

<p>Millions of mosquitoes and <i>piums</i>, <i>carrapatinhos</i> and
<i>carrapatos</i> made life unbearable both during the day
and night. We never had a moment's respite. The
gnats, too, in thick swarms around us were a constant
worry&mdash;we were all day busy removing them from our
eyes and ears. They stung us all over most mercilessly.
I was making a botanical collection, which not
only contained specimens of the leaves of all the trees
we met with, but also of minor plants and various kinds
of grass. This involved getting off my mule many
times a day. Whenever I put my feet on the ground
or touched a blade of grass I well knew what was in
store for me. At once I became literally covered with
<i>carrapatinhos</i>, and set to scratch myself so violently that
nothing short of digging my nails into my skin seemed
to relieve the irritation&mdash;and that, mind you, only
momentarily. One had to bear it, and wait until
one got to camp in the evening before one could disinfect
oneself all over. In this world one never gets
credit for anything, but I do think that few men under
those circumstances would have gone on, as I did,
collecting botanical specimens for no reward whatever
except my own pleasure, if pleasure it can be called.</p>

<p>Again we noticed that day wonderful effects of
clouds in filaments, one group stretching along the
sky in an arc from north to east like the dorsal bone
and ribs of an immense fish.</p>

<p>We camped on the bank of a stream (elev. 1,050 ft.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-189" id="Pg_1-189"></a>[<a href="images/1-189.png">189</a>]</span>
flowing north-east, which was, I think, the same stream
we had met in the morning, and which had described
a big turn.</p>

<p>My men amused me with their fears. Even when
in camp they never left their rifles for a moment.
When they went only a few yards away, either to fetch
water or bring back a mule, they invariably took all
their weapons with them&mdash;carbines, automatic pistols,
and daggers.</p>

<p>In order to collect specimens and examine the
country, I sometimes strayed away alone for long
distances from camp&mdash;sometimes for two or three hours
at a time&mdash;always absolutely unarmed. My men
began to be thoroughly frightened of the immunity
I possessed from attacks of wild beasts and Indians.
Although I told them that wild beasts never attacked
human beings unless attacked first, and that there were
no Indians about, my men would not believe me.
They maintained that I must have some special secret
of my own which brought me back alive, and that I
must be even bullet-proof. They could never be
induced to go alone&mdash;even when armed&mdash;for more than
a few metres from camp.</p>

<p>We were having cool nights. Minimum 59&deg; Fahr.,
maximum 80&deg; Fahr.&mdash;on May 17th. A mackerel sky
of the prettiest design was overhead, like a lovely
mosaic of white and blue porcelain, while a band of
clear blue encircled us all around above the horizon line.</p>

<p>Across a forest we continued our journey, rising
some 300 ft. to 1,350 ft. above the sea level, where we
again found campos and forest alternately upon deep
masses of fine red sand or else great expanses of grey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-190" id="Pg_1-190"></a>[<a href="images/1-190.png">190</a>]</span>
and black volcanic cinders intermixed in patches. On
reaching the highest elevation we actually went over
6 kil. of volcanic sand and ashes, and in one place
traversed a patch of shattered d&eacute;bris with cutting edges
of eruptive rock, and brilliant red or deep black pebbles.
Then again we saw masses of the usual ferruginous,
much-perforated rocks&mdash;many so absolutely spherical
as to resemble cannon-balls.</p>

<p>To the west we could see before us lovely green undulations&mdash;campos&mdash;with,
in the centre, a curious hump
that looked as though due to subterranean pressure.
In the distance was visible another of those long flat-topped
plateaus typical of Brazil, with a headland
which, owing, it seemed, chiefly to erosion, had become
separated from the main range. It resembled and was
parallel with the second range of the split mountains we
had just left. Some nine kilometres from our last camp
we encountered the river Das Corgo, flowing south
(elev. 1,150 ft.) over a bed formed by an impressive
great flow of solidified red lava covered in some places
by deposits of bright red earth. Beyond the river we
found ourselves again upon yellow sand and ashes.</p>

<p>Beneath a cirro-cumulus&mdash;or mackerel sky&mdash;again
that day, wonderfully beautiful because of its perfection
of design, we were gradually rising over the
domed elevation we had previously observed, upon
which we found masses of tiny pebbles&mdash;what are
known to geologists by the Italian name of "puzzolana"
or <i>scori&aelig;</i> reduced to a granular condition.
Farther on, travelling over other undulations, we sank
into thick deposits of grey and yellow volcanic scori&aelig;,
such as fine sand, cinders, and lapilli. At the highest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-191" id="Pg_1-191"></a>[<a href="images/1-191.png">191</a>]</span>
point (elev. 1,270 ft.) we travelled over deep sediments
of sand and ashes mixed together. All those undulations,
as a matter of fact, were above great buried
flows of red lava, which were invariably exposed to
sight in the depressions, particularly in the beds of
rivers.</p>

<p>Being a great lover of good water&mdash;to my mind
the elixir of life, the great secret of health and strength&mdash;I
was always enraptured by the deliciousness of the
water in the streams we met. It was so crystalline
and limpid that one could not resist the temptation
of drinking it, even when not thirsty. I always carried
slung to my saddle an enamelled tin cup attached to a
string so as to be able to procure myself a drink at all
the streams without getting off my mount.</p>

<p>Twelve kilometres from our last camp we came to
a watercourse flowing into a big stream at the bottom
of the valley. Its bed was in overlapping terraces of
polished red lava.</p>

<p>The green country before us, in great sweeping
undulations, reminded one much, in its regularity, of
the great waves of the ocean&mdash;what sailors call "long
seas." Where the stream had cut through and left the
underlying dome of lava exposed one could easily judge
of the thick deposits of sand, ashes and pulverized rock
which formed the strata above it.</p>

<p>We travelled over more red volcanic sand for some
four kilometres, rising to 1,400 ft., on which elevation
was thick <i>matto</i>, or stunted, much entangled forest.
Then we emerged once more into glorious open country,
marching over a stratum 8 ft. thick of whitish tufa and
ashes, this stratum lying immediately above one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-192" id="Pg_1-192"></a>[<a href="images/1-192.png">192</a>]</span>
red volcanic earth. The strata were easily measurable
where rivulets had cut deep grooves in the softer
superficial strata and had reached the foundation layer
of lava.</p>

<p>The campos seemed to get more and more beautiful
as we went west. What magnificent grazing land!
One could imagine on it millions and millions of happy,
fat cattle; but no, not one was to be seen anywhere.
What a pity to see such wonderful country go to waste!
There was everything there, barring, perhaps, easy
transport, to make the happiness and fortune of thousands
upon thousands of farmers&mdash;excellent grazing,
fertile soil, good healthy climate and delicious and
plentiful water&mdash;but the country was absolutely deserted.</p>

<p>For miles the beautiful prairies extended, especially
to the south-west, where in the distant background
loomed a high, flat-topped tableland, interrupted by
two deep cuts in its extensive monotonous sky-line.
Those cuts were near its southern end. To the south
stood a long range of wooded hills&mdash;also with an absolutely
flat sky-line. We ourselves were not higher than
1,400 ft. above the sea level. My animals stumbled
along over a region of much-broken-up d&eacute;bris; then
again travelling was easier, although heavy, over tufa,
sand and ashes. On descending to a stream, 1,200 ft.
above sea level, we slipped terribly on the steep argillaceous
slope, and the animals had great difficulty in
climbing up on the opposite side, where we made our
camp.</p>

<p>The streamlet flowed east into a larger stream, which
we also crossed, and which flowed south-west.</p>

<p>It seemed to be getting colder at night as we went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-193" id="Pg_1-193"></a>[<a href="images/1-193.png">193</a>]</span>
westward (May 18th, min. 57&deg; Fahr.), whereas during
the day the temperature was hot&mdash;max. 97&deg; F. As
early as 9 a.m. the thermometer already registered 85&deg;
in the shade, and not a breath of wind. The elevation
was 1,150 ft. The sky was in streaky horizontal
clouds to the east, and thin misty clouds to the south&mdash;cirro-stratus.</p>

<p>One of my horses having strayed away a long distance,
we only left that camp in the afternoon after
the animal had been recovered. We rose quickly over
the usual red volcanic sand held down in its place by
the vegetation&mdash;rather an&aelig;mic at that particular spot.
Higher up we again sank in the white and yellow ashes,
with occasional zones covered by small, angular, black-baked
d&eacute;bris.</p>

<p>Ants seemed to flourish happily in that region, for
the ant-heaps were innumerable and of great size,
several with towers about 6 ft. in height, resembling
miniature medi&aelig;val castles.</p>

<p>Having risen&mdash;all the time over grey and white
ashes&mdash;to 1,420 ft., we found ourselves again upon open
campos with a splendid view of the flat-topped range
we had already seen to the north and of another to the
south. At the angle where the northern range changed
its direction slightly there stood a high prominence of
peculiar appearance. The range extended west, where
it ended, into a broken cone&mdash;as I have already stated
quite separated by erosion from the main range. All
along the range in the section between the prominence
at the angle and the terminal cone could be noticed
three distinct level terraces and several intermediate
ones&mdash;not yet well defined nor continuous along the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-194" id="Pg_1-194"></a>[<a href="images/1-194.png">194</a>]</span>
whole face of the range. About half-way along its
length, a semi-cylindrical vertical cut was a striking
feature, and appeared from a distance to be the
remains of an extinct crater. It may be noted that
where that crater was, the range was higher than
elsewhere. Its summit, with an undulating sky-line,
lay to the west of it, no doubt formed by erupted
matter. Other great vertical furrows were noticeable
not far from the crater and to the west of it.</p>

<p>The scenery was getting stranger and stranger
every day. We began to notice solitary domes and
cones in the landscape. That day, in fact, beyond
the great campos we had before us a curious little
well-rounded dome, standing up by itself upon an absolutely
flat surface, at a considerable distance from the flat
tableland which stood on one side, and of which formerly
it evidently made part. Higher mountains, somewhat
nearer to us, were on the south-west.</p>

<p>We had reached the River Corgo Fundo (elev.
1,250 ft.), along the banks of which the lamin&aelig; of red-baked
rock could be observed with thin white layers
between. Above was a lovely green pasture with a
tuft of deep green trees, which looked exactly like a bit
of a well-kept English park. We mounted up again
to 1,430 ft., then went down another descent into a
large plain with campos, upon which grew merely a
few stunted trees. We were still travelling over deep
deposits of sand.</p>

<p>The range to the north of us extended, to be
accurate, from north-east to south-west, and at its
south-westerly end possessed a dome not dissimilar
to the one already described on our previous day's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-195" id="Pg_1-195"></a>[<a href="images/1-195.png">195</a>]</span>
march. This one was perhaps more rounded and not
quite so tall. It rose above the plateau in two well-defined
terraces, especially on the north-east side, but
was slightly worn and smoothed to the south-west.
On the terminal mound&mdash;clearly separated from the
range by erosion&mdash;seven distinct terraces could be
counted, with some less defined intermediate ones.</p>

<p>In the bed of another stream flowing south&mdash;it was
impossible to ascertain the names of these streamlets,
for there was no one to tell, and none were marked
on existing maps&mdash;another great flow of red lava was
visible. This stream flowed into the Rio das Gar&ccedil;as
or Barreiros, only 500 metres away&mdash;an important
watercourse, throwing itself eastward into the Rio
das Mortes, one of the great tributaries of the upper

<div class="blockquot"><p>The River Barreiros&mdash;A Country of Tablelands</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Rio Barreiros was about 100 metres wide. It was
reached through a thick belt, 100 metres in width, of
trees and bamboos of large diameter, which lined both
its banks. The river flowed swiftly where we crossed it,
over a bed of lava and baked rock, red and black, with
huge treacherous pits and holes which rendered the
job of crossing the stream dangerous for our animals.
There were rapids lower down in the terraced mass of
rock forming the river bottom. The rock, worn smooth
by the water, was extremely slippery. It was only
after we had all undressed and taken the baggage
safely across on our heads&mdash;the river being too deep
for the loads to remain on the saddles&mdash;that we successfully
drove the animals over to the opposite bank.</p>

<p>On the banks I collected some specimens of the
laminated red rock, which had no great crushing
resistance when dry. It could be easily powdered under
comparatively light pressure, and scratched with no
difficulty with one's nails. It was of various densities
of red tones, according to the amount of baking it had
undergone. The superposed red strata had a dip northward
in some localities. The rock was much fissured,
and had either gone through excessive contraction in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-197" id="Pg_1-197"></a>[<a href="images/1-197.png">197</a>]</span>
cooling or else perhaps had been shattered by some
earthly commotion&mdash;such as must have occurred often
in that region in ages gone by, for, if not, how could one
account for finding scattered blocks of this red rock
resting upon the surface of great stretches&mdash;sometimes
for 20 or 30 kil.&mdash;of uninterrupted sand or ashes which
covered such great expanses of that country?</p>

<p>In the valleys, near water, <i>burity</i> palms were
numerous.</p>

<p>Overhead the sky was always interesting. The
days nearly invariably began with a clear, speckless sky,
but, mind you, never of quite so deep a blue as the sky
of Italy or Egypt. The sky of Central Brazil was
always of a whitish cobalt blue. That morning&mdash;an
exception to prove the rule&mdash;we had awakened to a
thick mist around us, which enveloped and damped
everything. No sooner did the sun rise than the mist
was quickly dispelled. In the late morning, about 10
o'clock, clouds began to form high in the sky&mdash;not along
the horizon, as is generally the case in most countries&mdash;and
grew in intensity and size during the afternoon.
Nearly every day at about sunset a peculiar flimsy,
almost transparent, streak of mist stretched right
across the sky from east to west, either in the shape of
a curved line, or, as we had observed as recently as the
day before, resembling with its side filaments a gigantic
feather or the skeleton of a fish.</p>

<p>In the State of Goyaz, it may be remembered, we
had a more beautiful and complete effect at sunset of
many radiating lines, starting from the east and joining
again to the west, but here we merely had one
single streak dividing the sky in two. When the sun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-198" id="Pg_1-198"></a>[<a href="images/1-198.png">198</a>]</span>
had long disappeared under the horizon, that streak
high up in the sky was still lighted by its rays&mdash;becoming
first golden, then red. The effect was quite weird.</p>

<p>My men went during the night on another fishing
expedition, but with no luck&mdash;partly due to the infamy
of our dogs. They used as bait for their large hooks
<i>toucinho</i>, or pork fat, of which they had started out
provided with a huge piece. They walked off a good
distance from camp to find a suitable spot. Unfortunately,
while they were there the dogs ate up all the
<i>toucinho</i> and the result was that the men had to return
disappointed. There was plenty of game, especially
wild pig and <i>veado</i> (deer).</p>

<p>Alcides had a smattering of botany, which was a
great danger to the company. He knew, he thought,
the uses, medicinal or otherwise, of all plants, herbs
and fruit, wild or not wild. This, in addition to the
greediness of the men&mdash;who, although actually gorged
with food, were always willing to devour anything else
they found&mdash;led once or twice, as we shall see, to the
poisoning of himself and his companions so dangerously
as not only to cause terrible internal pains, but to
bring them all actually to death's door.</p>

<p>I never got poisoned myself, as I generally took
good care to watch the effects of those experiments
upon my men first. Then also in my many years of
exploration I had learnt only too well to beware of
even the most seductive tropical plants and fruit.
Notwithstanding all this, Alcides was really wonderful
at turning out pleasant-tasting beverages from the
stewed bark or leaves of various trees, and of these
decoctions&mdash;in which additional quantities of sugar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-199" id="Pg_1-199"></a>[<a href="images/1-199.png">199</a>]</span>
played an important part&mdash;my men and myself drank
gallons upon gallons. Many of those drinks had
powerful astringent qualities and had severe effects
upon the bladder, but some were indeed quite good
and innocuous.</p>

<p>During the night I observed a most perfect lunar
halo, the circle, close to the moon, displaying a curious
yellowish red outer fringe.</p>

<p>Since leaving the Araguaya we had been bothered
a good deal nightly by the heavy dew, which absolutely
soaked everything, made all our rifles and axes and
iron implements rusty, and the tents and saddles and
baggage considerably heavier for the animals to carry,
owing to the moisture they had absorbed. In the early
morning we began to get thick cold mist, and it was
about that time that the minimum temperature was
usually registered&mdash;58&deg; Fahr. that particular night,
May 19th. We were at quite a low elevation, merely
1,100 ft. When we started in the morning we found
more sand and volcanic d&eacute;bris over ridges some 100 ft.
or so above the level of the river. A torrent, 15 metres
wide, flowing swiftly W.S.W. on a red lava bed, was
crossed, the mules slipping terribly on the polished rock.
More ashes and sand were found as we ascended to an
elevation of 1,200 ft., from which height we discerned a
much-terraced headland to the east and two streams
meeting and flowing south where we eventually crossed
them. One of those watercourses descended in cascades
over laminated successive flows of lava, between which
thin layers of white crystallization could be seen.</p>

<p>Slightly higher, at 1,250 ft., we sank again in yellow
and grey ashes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-200" id="Pg_1-200"></a>[<a href="images/1-200.png">200</a>]</span>
Across campos we reached another foaming torrent,
flowing as usual over a lava bed, but this time in a
north-westerly instead of in a southerly direction. That
day we met with many watercourses. Having risen to
1,450 ft., we soon after found another streamlet (elev.
1,230 ft.). Again a red lava-flow was exposed in its
bed and showed heavy upper deposits of grey ashes,
with above them a thick layer of yellow-ochre sand
(1,300 ft.).</p>

<p>The distances on the journey were measured by
a watch, the speed of the animals at the time being
naturally taken into consideration. It was not possible
to use the usual bicycle wheel with a meter attached,
which is used with so much success in the Arctic
regions or in countries where travelling more or less in a
straight line and on a level surface is possible.</p>

<p>Another limpid stream flowing south-west (elev.
1,200 ft.) was reached, then more deep sand and
ashes. After that we came to a thick growth of bamboos
and brush on reaching the banks of a streamlet winding
its way north.</p>

<p>Travelling up and down, all day and day after day,
over those undulations became tedious work&mdash;red sand,
whitish sand, grey ashes, all the time.</p>

<p class="figcenter">(Alcides in foreground.)</p>
<hr />
<p>On the west side, on descending the last prominence
we at last came to a slight variation in the geological
composition of the country. After more white sand
and ashes had been passed, we came upon great
stretches of greenish grey granite exposed in huge
domes and much striated, with parallel grooves on its
surface so deep that they almost looked as if they had
been incised by a sharp tool. These grooves were,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-201" id="Pg_1-201"></a>[<a href="images/1-201.png">201</a>]</span>
nevertheless, naturally caused by the sharp friction of
sand and water, I think, and also by sand blown over
those rocks with terrific force by winds of inconceivable
vigour. All the way down our descent we travelled
over that striated rock. It had become exposed to
the air, but must have once been buried under sand
and ashes like all the rest of that region. Curious
vertical cracks were to be noticed in several places,
with ramifications from a common centre&mdash;evidently
caused by the concussion of some huge weight which
had fallen from above, perhaps a huge boulder shot
out by volcanic action, which had then rolled farther
down the incline.</p>

<p>The terminal side of the curious range we had on
our right appeared not unlike a fortress with its vertical
walls standing upon a slanting bastion.</p>

<p>At the bottom (elev. 1,200 ft.) of the great dome
of granite we had travelled upon we crossed a stream
flowing south-west, the water of which was quite warm.
The high temperature was due, I think, to the heat
absorbed by the rock exposed to the sun and communicated
to the water flowing over it, rather than to a
thermal origin.</p>

<p>Continuing our journey, we had to the south a great
hollow basin in the south-western end of the range,
with two hillocks between the range itself and the
flat boundary plateau to the south.</p>

<p>The highest point of the hill on which we travelled
was 1,450 ft. above the sea level. Every metre we
travelled westward became more strangely interesting.
We were now upon a conglomerate of bespattered lava-drops
encased in a coating of solidified ashes. When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-202" id="Pg_1-202"></a>[<a href="images/1-202.png">202</a>]</span>
we reached the stream we had to go through a dark
tunnel of dense vegetation, great ferns, giant palms,
creepers with their abundant foliage, and tall trees
festooned with liane. Having crossed this dark
vegetable passage, we emerged once more into lovely
open campos.</p>

<p>Great lumpy globular woolly clouds faced us in
the sky to the west. Horizontal intermittent white
layers were close to the horizon to the east, then three
parallel lines of feathery mist to the north-west. In
quantity of clouds the sky that day would meteorologically
be described as C 4&mdash;which means that four-tenths
of the sky vault was covered.</p>

<p>One could not help being struck in Central Brazil by
the almost absolute immobility of the clouds. One
seldom experienced a strong wind; contrary to what
must have taken place there in ages gone by, when that
country must have been the very home of terrific air-currents
and disturbances on a scale beyond all conception.
It was only occasionally that a light breeze&mdash;merely
in gusts of a few seconds&mdash;would refresh one's
ears and eyes as one marched on. What was more
remarkable still was the sudden change of direction
of those spasmodic gusts of wind when they did come.</p>

<p>From a river (elev. 1,250 ft.) we proceeded over
undulations to 1,550 ft. There we were treated to
an extensive and beautiful view to the west, south-west
and north-west. The elevated sky-line formed by the
plateau and mountains was quite straight, barring
three much eroded mountains standing quite isolated
and at a great distance from one another.</p>

<p>One of these solitary elevations was to the south-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-203" id="Pg_1-203"></a>[<a href="images/1-203.png">203</a>]</span>west,
another&mdash;the castle-like mountain of great height
we had already observed&mdash;stood due west. Then came
the long flat line of the plateau but for a gentle
convexity at each end. The plateau, dressed in thick
forest, stood in the middle distance to the west-south-west.
Campos of great beauty were prominent on its
slopes and in the two hollows in the immediate vicinity.</p>

<p>As we wound our way forward we found masses of
ferruginous black rock, black d&eacute;bris, and beautiful
crystals.</p>

<p>The silence of that wonderful landscape was impressive.
The tinkling of my mules' neck-bells was
the only cheering sound breaking that monotonous
solitude&mdash;except perhaps the occasional harsh voices
of my men urging on the animals with some unrepeatable
oath or other.</p>

<p>Filippe, the negro&mdash;to be distinguished from the
other Filippi in my employ, a mulatto&mdash;was mounted
on one of my best mules. He carried a regular armoury
on his back and round his waist, for not only did he
carry his own rifle but also mine, besides a pistol and
two large knives. He rode along, slashing with a
long whip now at one mule then at another. Occasionally
he treated us to some of his improvised melodies&mdash;not
at all bad and quite harmonious, although one
got rather tired of the incessant repetitions. Filippe
was a pure negro, born in Brazil from ex-slaves. He
had never been in Africa. His songs interested me,
for although much influenced naturally by modern
Brazilian and foreign airs he had heard at Araguary,
still, when he forgot himself and his surroundings, he
would relapse unconsciously into the ululations and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-204" id="Pg_1-204"></a>[<a href="images/1-204.png">204</a>]</span>
plaintive notes and rhythm typical of his ancestral
land in Central Africa&mdash;that of the Banda tribe,
which I happened to have visited some years before.
I identified him easily by his features, as well as by his
music and other characteristics.</p>

<p>Filippe did not remember his father and mother,
nor had he known any other relatives. He had no idea
to what tribe he had belonged, he did not know any
African language, and he had never to his remembrance
knowingly heard African music. It was remarkable
under those circumstances that the Central African
characteristics should recur unconsciously in Filippe's
music. It showed me that one is born with or without
certain racial musical proclivities, dictated by the
heart and brain. They cannot be eradicated for many
generations, no matter what the place of birth may be
or the different surroundings in which the individual
may find himself, or the influences which may affect
him even early in life.</p>

<p>Brazil was certainly a great country for tablelands.
As we came out again into the open, another great
plateau, ending with a spur not unlike the ram of a
battleship, loomed in the foreground to the south.
Yet another plateau of a beautiful pure cobalt, also
with another gigantic ram, appeared behind the first,
in continuation of the two separated plateaux we have
already examined. It was separated from these by a
deep cut&mdash;a regular ca&ntilde;on&mdash;several miles wide, and
with sides so sharply defined that it looked like the
artificial work of an immense canal.</p>

<p>Great campos lay before us in the near foreground,
from our high point of vantage (elev. 1,550 ft.). We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-205" id="Pg_1-205"></a>[<a href="images/1-205.png">205</a>]</span>
were still travelling on a surface of volcanic d&eacute;bris,
yellow ashes and sand&mdash;forming a mere cap over all
those hills, the foundation of which was simply a succession
of giant domes of lava.</p>

<p>North-west we still had the almost flat sky-line of
a plateau rising slightly in two well-defined steps or
terraces to a greater height in its northern part. What
most attracted me that day was the delightful view
of the Barreiros valley spreading before us&mdash;a view of
truly extraordinary grandeur.</p>

<p>We rapidly descended, leaving to our left the Indian
colony of Aracy. Great granitic and lava slabs, much
striated, were seen on our way down to the river
(elev. 1,200 ft.). The stream was 50 metres wide,
and flowed south where we crossed it. There was a
handsome white sand beach on the left bank of the
river. On the western, or right bank, stood great
volcanic cliffs of boiled and broiled rock, interesting
for the violent contortions they had undergone during
the processes of ebullition, which showed plainly in
their present solidified form.</p>

<p>The river bed itself was one of the usual lava-flows
with huge globular lumps and knots&mdash;but all in a
solid, uninterrupted mass.</p>

<p>We waded chest-deep across the stream, conveyed
our baggage and mules to the opposite side, and then
we all enjoyed a lovely bath with plenty of lathering
soap in the deliciously refreshing waters of the Rio
Barreiros.</p>

<p>The river Barreiros, which had its birth in the Serra
Furnas Corros, to the south-west, entered the Rio das
Gar&ccedil;as&mdash;there 100 metres wide&mdash;a short distance from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-206" id="Pg_1-206"></a>[<a href="images/1-206.png">206</a>]</span>
where we crossed it. The latter river, by far the
larger of the two and of a very circuitous course,
flowed in a south-easterly direction into the Araguaya.
The Rio das Gar&ccedil;as, which also had its origin in the
Furnas Corros Mountains, had almost a parallel course
with the upper Barreiros from south-west to north-east,
but on meeting the Barreiros suddenly swung
round at a sharp angle towards the south-east, which
direction it more or less followed until it entered the
Araguaya.</p>

<p>We made our camp on the right bank of the Barreiros
River. My men were in a great state of mind
when I told them that perhaps on this river we might
find some Indians. The cautious way in which they
remained as quiet as lambs in camp amused me. I
noticed the care with which they cleaned their rifles
and replenished their magazines with cartridges. I
assured them that there was no danger&mdash;in fact, that
quite close to this place we should find one of the
Salesian colonies.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Bororo Indians</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">While</span> I was reassuring my men an Indian appeared,
bow and arrows in hand. He stood motionless, looking
at us. My men, who had not noticed his coming, were
terrified when they turned round and saw him.</p>

<p>The Indian was a strikingly picturesque figure, with
straight, sinewy arms and legs of wonderfully perfect
anatomical modelling, well-shaped feet&mdash;but not small&mdash;and
hands. He was not burdened with clothing;
in fact, he wore nothing at all, barring a small belt
round his waist and a fibre amulet on each arm.</p>

<p>The Indian deposited his bow and arrows against
a tree when some other Indians arrived. He stood
there as straight and as still as a bronze statue, his
head slightly inclined forward in order to screen his
searching eagle eyes from the light by the shade of his
protruding brow. He folded his arms in a peculiar
manner. His left hand was inserted flat under the right
arm, the right hand fully spread flat upon his abdomen.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was to take a snapshot of him
before he moved. Then I proceeded to the interesting
study of his features. They were indeed a great revelation
to me. One single glance at him and his comrades
persuaded me that a theory I had long cherished
about the aboriginal population of the South American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-208" id="Pg_1-208"></a>[<a href="images/1-208.png">208</a>]</span>
continent was correct, although in contradiction to
theories held by other people on the subject. I had
always believed&mdash;for reasons which I shall fully explain
later&mdash;that South America must be peopled by tribes
of an Australoid or Papuan type&mdash;people who had got
there directly from the west or south-west, not by
people who had gradually drifted there from the north.</p>

<p>Some scientists&mdash;with no experience of travel&mdash;have
been greatly misled by the fact that the North
American Indians are decidedly a Mongolian race.
Therefore they assumed&mdash;basing their assumption on
incorrect data&mdash;that the unknown Indians of South
America must also be Mongolian. This was a mistake,
although undoubtedly migrations on a comparatively
small scale of Indians from North to South America
must have taken place, chiefly along the western
American coast. Those tribes, however, unaccustomed
to high mountains, never crossed the Andes. Whatever
types of Indians with Mongolian characteristics were
found settled in South America were to be found to
the west of the Andes and not to the east. This does
not of course mean that in recent years, when roads
and railways and steamships have been established, and
communication made comparatively easy, individuals or
families may not have been conveyed from one coast
to the other of the South American continent. But I
wish my reader to keep in mind for a moment a clear
distinction between the Indians of the western coast
and the Indians of the interior.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill1-208.jpg"><img src="images/ill1-208_th.jpg" alt="A Fine Bororo Type on a Visit to Author's Camp." title="A Fine Bororo Type on a Visit to Author's Camp." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">A Fine Bororo Type on a Visit to Author's Camp.</p>
<hr />
<p>To return to our man: I was greatly impressed by
the strongly Australoid or Papuan nose he possessed&mdash;in
other words, broad, with the lower part forming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-209" id="Pg_1-209"></a>[<a href="images/1-209.png">209</a>]</span>
a flattened, depressed, somewhat enlarged hook with
heavy nostrils. In profile his face was markedly
convex, not concave as in Mongolian faces. Then the
glabella or central boss in the supra-orbital region, the
nose, the chin, were prominent, the latter broad and
well-rounded. The cheek-bones with him and other
types of his tribe were prominent forwards, but not
unduly broad laterally, so that the face in front view
was, roughly speaking, of a long oval, but inclined to be
more angular&mdash;almost shield-shaped. The lips were
medium-sized and firmly closed, such as in more
civilized people would denote great determination. His
ears were covered up by long jet-black hair, perfectly
straight and somewhat coarse in texture, healthy-looking
and uniformly scattered upon the scalp. The
hair was cut straight horizontally high upon the forehead,
which thus showed a considerable slant backward
from the brow to the base of the hair. A small
pigtail hung behind the head. The hair at the sides
was left to grow down so as fully to cover the lobes of
the ears, where again it was cut horizontally at the
sides and back of the head. The top of the head was
of great height, quite unlike a Mongolian cranium.</p>

<p>The eyes&mdash;close to the nose, and of a shiny dark
brown&mdash;had their long axis nearly in one horizontal
plane. They were set rather far back, were well cut,
with thick upper eyelids, and placed somewhat high
up against the brow ridges so as to leave little room for
exposure of the upper lid when open.</p>

<p>None of the other Indians, who had gradually
assembled, wore a particle of clothing, barring a tight
conical collar of orange-coloured fibre encircling their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-210" id="Pg_1-210"></a>[<a href="images/1-210.png">210</a>]</span>
genital organs&mdash;so tight that it almost cut into the
skin. Without this solitary article of clothing no
Indian man will allow himself to be seen by another,
less still by a stranger. But with so modest an attire
he feels as well-dressed as anybody. I think that this
elegant article of fashion must have originated as a
sanitary precaution, in order to prevent insects of all
kinds, and particularly <i>carrapatos</i>, penetrating within&mdash;or
else I was really at a loss to understand of what other use
it could be. They themselves would not say, and only
replied that all Bororo Indian men wore it. The Indians
who had assembled all belonged to the Bororo tribe.</p>

<p>On that, as well as on later occasions, I noticed two
distinct types among the Bororos: one purely Papuan
or Polynesian; the other strongly Malay. The characteristics
of those two different types showed themselves
markedly in every instance. The majority were
perhaps of the Malay type. I was intensely interested
at the astounding resemblance of these people to the
piratical tribes of the Sulu Archipelago in the Celebes
Sea, where, too, one met a considerable amount of
mixture of those two types as well as specimens of
pure types of the two races.</p>

<p>Among the Bororos many were the individuals&mdash;of
the Malay type&mdash;who had the typical Malay eye <i>&agrave;
fleur de t&ecirc;te</i>, prominent, almond-shaped, and slightly
slanting at the outer angle. The nose&mdash;unlike that of
Papuan types&mdash;was flattened in its upper region between
the eyes, and somewhat button-like and turned
up at the lower part&mdash;just the reverse of the Papuan
types, who had prominent aquiline noses with a high
bridge and globular point turned down instead of up.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-211" id="Pg_1-211"></a>[<a href="images/1-211.png">211</a>]</span>
The lips were in no case unduly prominent, nor
thick. They were almost invariably kept tightly
closed.</p>

<p>The form of the palate was highly curious from an
anthropological point of view. It was almost rectangular,
the angles of the front part being slightly wider
than a right angle.</p>

<p>The front teeth were of great beauty, and were not
set, as in most jaws, on a more or less marked curve,
but were almost on a straight line&mdash;the incisors being
almost absolutely vertical and meeting the side teeth
at an angle of about 60&deg;. The upper teeth overlapped
the lower ones.</p>

<p>The chin was well developed&mdash;square and flattened
in the Papuan types, but receding, flat and small in
the Malay types.</p>

<p>Both types were absolutely hairless on the face and
body, which was partly natural and partly due to the
tribal custom of pulling out carefully, one by one,
each hair they possessed on the upper lip and upon
the body&mdash;a most painful process. The women&mdash;as we
shall see&mdash;in sign of deep mourning, also plucked out
each hair of the scalp.</p>

<p>A striking characteristic of the head&mdash;in Papuan
types&mdash;was the great breadth of the maximum transverse
of the head, and the undue prominence of the
supra-orbital ridges. Also, the great height of the
forehead and its great width in its upper part were
typical of the race. The maximum antero-posterior
diameter of the skull was equal, in many cases, to the
vertical length of the head, taken from the angle of
the jaw to the apex of the skull.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-212" id="Pg_1-212"></a>[<a href="images/1-212.png">212</a>]</span>
The ears nearly invariably showed mean, under-developed
lobes, but, strangely enough, were otherwise
well shaped, with gracefully defined and chiselled curves.
They were not unduly large, with a wonderfully well-formed
concha, which fact explained why the acoustic
properties of their oral organs were perfect. They
made full use of this in long-distance signalling by means
of acute whistles, of which the Bororos had a regular code.</p>

<p>The favourite form of earring adopted by the
Bororos was a brass ring with a metal or shell crescent,
not unlike the Turkish moon, but I do not think that
this ornament was of Bororo origin. Very likely it
was suggested by the cheap jewellery imported into
Brazil by Turkish and Syrian traders.</p>

<p>They displayed powerful chests, with ribs well
covered with flesh and muscle. With their dark yellow
skins they were not unlike beautiful bronze torsi. The
abdominal region was never unduly enlarged, perhaps
owing to the fact that their digestion was good, and
also because they took a considerable amount of daily
exercise. In standing they kept their shoulders well
back, the abdominal region being slightly in front of
the chest. The head was usually slightly inclined
downwards.</p>

<p>The feet of the Bororos of the Malay type were
generally stumpy, but this was not so with the higher
Papuan types, who, on the contrary, had abnormally
long toes and elongated feet, rather flattened. The
Bororos used their toes almost as much as their fingers,
and showed great dexterity in picking up things, or
in spinning twine, when their toes did quite as much
work as their fingers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-213" id="Pg_1-213"></a>[<a href="images/1-213.png">213</a>]</span>
The colour of the iris of the Bororo eye was brown,
with considerable discoloration around its outer periphery,
and especially in the upper part, where it was
covered by the lid. The eyes were generally kept half
closed.</p>

<p>The anatomical detail of the body was perfectly
balanced. The arms were powerful, but with fine,
well-formed wrists&mdash;exquisitely chiselled, as were all
the attachments of their limbs. They had quite
graceful hands, long-fingered&mdash;in more ways than one&mdash;and
wonderfully well-shaped, elongated, convex-faced
nails, which would arouse the envy of many a
lady of Western countries. The webbing between the
fingers was infinitesimal, as with most Malay races.
Great refinement of race was also to be noticed in the
shape of their legs&mdash;marvellously modelled, without an
ounce of extra flesh, and with small ankles.</p>

<p>The Bororos divided themselves into two separate
families&mdash;the Bororo Cerados and the Bororo Tugaregghi.
The first descended from Baccoron; the second claimed
descent from Ittibori. Baccoron lived where the sun
set, in the west; Ittibari dwelt in the east.</p>

<p>I heard a strange legend in connection with their
origin, in which they seemed proud of their descent
from the jaguar&mdash;which to them represented the type
of virility. A male jaguar, they said, had married a
Bororo woman.</p>

<p>A sensible custom existed among the Bororos, as
among the Tuaregs of the Sahara desert in Africa. The
children took the name of the mother and not of the
father. The Bororos, like the Tuaregs, rightly claimed
that there could be no mistake as to who the mother of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-214" id="Pg_1-214"></a>[<a href="images/1-214.png">214</a>]</span>
a child was, but that certainty did not always apply to
the father. This was decidedly a sensible law among
the Bororos, who were most inconstant in their affections.
They were seldom faithful to their wives&mdash;at
least, for any length of time.</p>

<p>The Bororos were not prolific. They frequently
indulged in criminal practices in order to dispose of
their young&mdash;either by strangulation at birth or soon
after, or by drugging their women before the birth
of the child. The young, when allowed to live, took
milk from their mothers until the ages of five or six
years. The parents were extremely kind to their
children; indeed, they were extraordinarily good-natured
and considerate. Eight days after birth they
perforated the lower lip of male children and inserted
a pendant, taking that opportunity to give a name to
the child. The lobes of the ears were only perforated
at the age of ten or twelve.</p>

<p>It was only at the age of about twenty that men
were allowed to marry.</p>

<p>I found among the Bororos an interesting custom
which I had seen but once before&mdash;in Central Asia, on
the slopes of the Himalaya Mountains, among the
Shoka tribesmen. I am referring to the "clubs"&mdash;called
by the Bororos <i>Wai manna ghetgiao</i>. There the
young men and girls went not only with the object of
selecting a wife or husband, but also to get thoroughly
acquainted and see if the mate selected were suitable
or not. The men sat on one side of the club-house&mdash;a
mere hut&mdash;the women on the other. In a way, these
clubs prevented hasty marriages, for the men were
given plenty of time to study their prospective brides<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-215" id="Pg_1-215"></a>[<a href="images/1-215.png">215</a>]</span>
and the girls their future husbands. Curiously enough,
in the Bororo country it was generally the woman who
proposed to the man. When the official engagement
was made the man proceeded to the hut of his sweetheart
and brought a gift of food for her and her mother.
If the gifts were accepted there was no other formality
to be gone through, and the matrimonial ceremony was
indeed of the simplest kind. The man took away the
girl to his hut and they were man and wife.</p>

<p>The <i>cuisine</i> of the Bororos was not attractive to
European palate, ears or eyes. One of the favourite
dishes of the Bororos, served on grand occasions, was
the <i>mingao</i>, or Indian corn chewed up into a paste
inside their mouths by women and then displayed before
the guests in earthen pots filled with fresh water, in
which it was then cooked.</p>

<p>The Bororos maintained that the sun, <i>Cervado</i>, and
the moon, <i>Ittary</i>, were two brothers, both being males.</p>

<p>They believed in a superior Being&mdash;the essence of
goodness and kindness&mdash;a Being who will never give
pain or hurt anybody; therefore the Bororo, who was
really at heart a great philosopher, never offered
prayers to that superior Being. Why pray and worry
one who will never injure us? they argued.</p>

<p>Then they believed in a wicked and revengeful devil,
the <i>Bopp&eacute;</i>, to whom constant attention was paid because
by him was caused all the trouble that humans can
have. Malady, accidents, disaster in love, in hunting
or fishing expeditions&mdash;for all these the devil <i>Bopp&eacute;</i>
was responsible.</p>

<p>Then they had also another evil spirit&mdash;the <i>Aroe
Taurari</i>&mdash;who, they said, often assumed the appear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-216" id="Pg_1-216"></a>[<a href="images/1-216.png">216</a>]</span>ance
of their ancestors in order to come and watch the
games of the Bororos, such as wrestling and archery.
Wrestling&mdash;in the catch-as-catch-can style&mdash;was one
of their favourite games. They were very agile at it.
Their favourite trick was to seize each other across
the shoulders, each endeavouring to trip his opponent
by a twisted leg round his knee. Children in the
<i>aldejas</i> were playing at this game all the time. In the
Bororo wrestling-matches it was sufficient to be thrown
down to be the loser, and it was not essential to touch
the ground with both shoulder-blades.</p>

<p>The only other game I saw among the Bororos was
the test of strength. It was carried out with a most
striking article&mdash;a great wheel made of sections, each
one foot long, of the trunk of the <i>burity</i> palm tied
together by double strings of fibre. The ribbon thus
formed by them was rolled so as to make a solid wheel
of heavy wood 6 ft. in diameter. The whole was retained
in a circular form by a strong belt of vegetable
fibre. This great wheel was used by the Bororos in
their sports, at festivals, for testing the strength
of the most powerful men. It was so heavy that few
men could lift it at all, the great test being actually
to place it on one's head and keep it there for a
length of time.</p>

<p>The Indians of South America, like the Indians of
North America, revelled in decorating themselves with
the feathers of brightly-coloured birds. The red,
yellow and blue giant macaws, fairly common in that
region, paid dearly for this fashion of the Indians.
Many of those poor birds were kept in captivity and
plucked yearly of all their feathers in order to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-217" id="Pg_1-217"></a>[<a href="images/1-217.png">217</a>]</span>
hair ornaments of beautiful blue and green plumage
for the leading musician, who rattled the <i>bacco</i> (a gourd
full of pebbles which can make a terrible noise), or else
armlets, earrings or necklaces. Some of the designs
woven with the tiniest feathers of those birds were
quite clever, and required delicate handling in their
manufacture. Ducks, too, supplied many of the
feathers for the ornaments of the Bororos.</p>

<p>Their cooking utensils were simple enough&mdash;merely
a few large earthen bowls, badly baked and unglazed,
the largest of which was seldom more than
2 ft. in diameter. They broke easily, being made
extremely thin.</p>

<p>The Bororos made basket-work by plaiting dried
palm-leaves, but their most interesting work of all
consisted in the really beautifully made fishing nets.
Nearly all the Indians of South America showed remarkable
talent and patience at this work. The strings
were twisted of a vegetable fibre, extremely resisting,
and eminently suitable by its softness and regularity
of diameter.</p>

<p>Whether owing to excitement, indigestion or other
causes, the Bororos had visions, which they attributed
to the <i>Aroe Taurari</i>. In a certain way they were
believers in the transmigration of the soul&mdash;not generally,
but in specific cases.</p>

<p>There were certain Bororos who, by magic songs,
professed to fascinate animals in the forest and were
able to catch them. The <i>barih</i> or medicine-man generally,
assisted in those incantations.</p>

<p>The Bororos were remarkable walkers. They were
extremely light on their feet and had a springy gait,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-218" id="Pg_1-218"></a>[<a href="images/1-218.png">218</a>]</span>
most graceful to watch. A striking characteristic of
these people was that, when standing&mdash;unlike nearly
every other tribe of savages I have seen&mdash;they spread
their toes outward instead of keeping both feet parallel.
To a lesser extent the feet were held in that position
also when walking. The suppleness of their bodies
gave them a great advantage in penetrating with ease
anywhere in the forest without having to cut their
way through.</p>

<p>Both men and women were passionately fond of
dancing, although their dancing had not reached any
degree of perfection. With a strip of <i>burity</i> palm upon
their shoulders they hopped around, monotonously
chanting, with a rhythmic occasional jump, the women
following the men.</p>

<p>The women possessed considerable endurance. They
could carry heavy weights for long distances by means
of a fibre headband resting on the forehead. Under
those circumstances the body was kept slightly inclined
forward. Children were also carried in a similar
fashion in a sling, only&mdash;less practically than among
many Asiatic and African tribes&mdash;the Bororo children
were left to dangle their legs, thereby increasing the
difficulty of carrying them, instead of sitting with legs
astride across the mother's haunches. I was amazed
to see until what age Bororo mothers and sisters would
carry the young upon their shoulders&mdash;certainly children
of five or six years of age were being carried about
in this fashion, while such hard duties as pounding
Indian corn, thrashing beans, and hut-building, were
attended to.</p>

<p>Neither in women nor in men was the power of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-219" id="Pg_1-219"></a>[<a href="images/1-219.png">219</a>]</span>
resistance in any way to be compared with that of
the tribes of Central Africa or Asia. The Indian tribes
of Brazil impressed one as being strong, because one
compared them with their neighbours and masters,
the Brazilians, who were physically one of the weakest,
least-resisting races I have ever seen. When you
compared them with some of the healthy savage races
elsewhere, the Indians did not approach them in
endurance and quickness of intellect. Do not forget
that endurance is greatly due to brain power and self-control.
The Indian races I saw in Brazil seemed to
me almost exhausted physically, owing perhaps to
constant intermarriage among themselves. The eyesight
of the Bororos, for instance, was extremely bad.
There were many in every <i>aldeja</i> who were almost or
absolutely blind. The others were nearly all short-sighted.</p>

<p>The Bororos removed&mdash;pulled out, in fact&mdash;their
eyelashes one by one, as they believed it improved
their sight, especially for seeing at long distances. They
all suffered more or less from complaints of the eyes.
Indeed, I have seldom found races whose members
had eyes in such poor condition. Conjunctivitis was
the most prevalent form of eye disease. Ophthalmia
was frequently met with. They seemed to have no
efficacious method of curing those complaints, and
the result was that one found an appalling number
of blind or half-blind persons among them&mdash;quite out
of proportion to the small population. The Bororos
did not, of course, know of spectacles or any other
way of protecting the eyes. Even when their eyes were
in a normal condition, they nearly all had some defect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-220" id="Pg_1-220"></a>[<a href="images/1-220.png">220</a>]</span>
of vision. Squinting was frequently to be noticed
among them, and nearly invariably unevenness of the
eyes. Cataract was common at a comparatively early
age, and they knew no remedy for it. An abnormally
marked discoloration of the upper part of the iris
was constantly to be noticed even in young people.
Among the healthiest I never saw one man or woman
with extraordinary powers of vision such as are most
common among savage tribes of Asia and Africa. The
diseased condition of their blood was also perhaps to
a certain extent responsible for this.</p>

<p>Their hearing was good, but not much more acute
than with the average European&mdash;and infinitely inferior
to that of the natives of Asia and Africa. They
suffered considerably from the most terrible of blood
complaints, general among them, also from leprosy and
various skin troubles.</p>

<p>The Bororos made considerable use of the <i>urucu</i>
plant (<i>Bixa orellana</i> L.) which they called <i>nonoku</i>, from
the fruit of which they obtained a brilliant red colouring
matter for tinting their bows and arrows. The shell
of the fruit contained a number of shiny seeds, which,
when squashed, exuded a vivid red juice. It adhered
easily to the skin of the forehead and cheeks, for which
purpose the Indians also extensively used it.</p>

<p>The black paint which the Indians used for smearing
themselves across the forehead, cheeks, and upon the
shoulders, from side to side, was made to stick to
the skin and shine by mixing it with a resin.</p>

<p>The Bororos of the Rio Barreiros district carried
five arrows each with them, but each family of Bororos
used a special colour and also a different number of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-221" id="Pg_1-221"></a>[<a href="images/1-221.png">221</a>]</span>
arrows, so that no particular rule could be laid down
for the entire tribe. The red-tinted arm-band which
most men wore was called the <i>aguasso</i>.</p>

<p>Before starting on a hunting expedition of importance
the Bororos usually indulged in a feast.</p>

<p>I took a great number of thumb-marks among
them, some of which were remarkable for the precision
of the spiral lines from the central point, all over
the thumb point. Others in the longer thumbs showed
a peculiar deviation in the curve at the end, near the
point of the thumb. Where the lines began to deviate,
the triangle formed was filled in by other lines joining
those of the spiral at sharp angles.</p>

<p>The experiments with the dynamometer in order to
measure their strength, the anthropometric measurements
with a calliper, and the printing of the thumb-marks,
caused the Bororos first of all great anxiety,
then boisterous amusement. They looked upon it
all as utter nonsense&mdash;in a way I did not blame them&mdash;and
repeatedly asked why I did it. I told them
that I did it to find out where they came from.</p>

<p>"We are not monkeys," said they; "we do not
walk on our hands. If that is your object you should
look at our foot-marks on the ground, not at the marks
of our hands!"</p>

<p>With these words, from a tracker's point of view,
the local wit set the entire company in shrieks of
laughter at his quick repartee.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" said I; "but with the thumb-marks
I may perhaps trace, not only where you come from,
but also where your great-grandfather, who is now
dead, came from."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-222" id="Pg_1-222"></a>[<a href="images/1-222.png">222</a>]</span>
That was too much for them. All had been anxious
to make a smudge with smoke-black upon my note-book.
Now they all refused to do any more thumb-marking,
and walked away; but I had fortunately
already finished the work I needed from them.</p>

<p>The Bororos&mdash;in fact, most Indian tribes of Central
Brazil&mdash;knew nothing whatever of navigation. This
was chiefly due to the fact that all the woods of Central
Brazil had so high a specific gravity that not one of
them would float. Hence the impossibility of making
rafts, and the greatly increased difficulty in making
boats. As for making dug-outs, the Indians had
neither the patience nor the skill nor the tools to cut
them out of solid trees. Moreover, there was really
no reason why the Indians should take up navigation
at all when they could do very well without it. They
could easily get across the smaller streams without
boats, and they were too timid to go and attack inimical
tribes on the opposite banks of unfordable rivers.
Besides, the Indians were so few and the territory at
their entire disposal so great, that there was no temptation
for them to take up exploring, particularly by
water.</p>

<p>They were all good swimmers. When the river
was too deep to ford they merely swam across; or else,
if the river were too broad and swift, they improvised
a kind of temporary raft with fascines or bundles of
dried <i>burity</i> leaves, to which they clung, and which
they propelled with their feet. These fascines were
quite sufficient to keep them afloat for a short time,
enabling them also to convey a certain amount of goods
across the water.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-223" id="Pg_1-223"></a>[<a href="images/1-223.png">223</a>]</span>
In other countries, such as in Central Africa among
the Shilucks and the Nuers of the Sobat River (Sudan),
and the natives on Lake Tchad, I have seen a similar
method adopted in a far more perfected fashion. The
Shilucks, for instance, cleverly built big boats of fascines&mdash;large
enough to carry a great number of warriors.
Such was not the case with the bundles of <i>burity</i> of
the Indians&mdash;which merely served for one or at the
most two people at a time, and then only until the
bundle became soaked, when it went to the bottom.</p>

<p class="fsc">Bororo Indians.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Bororos were superstitious to a degree. They
believed in evil spirits. Some of these, they said,
inhabited the earth; others were invisible and lived
"all over the air," to use their expression. The aerial
ones were not so bad as those on earth. It was to the
latter that their invocations were made&mdash;not directly,
but through a special individual called the <i>barih</i>, a
kind of medicine man, who, shouting at the top of his
voice while gazing skyward, offered gifts of food, meat,
fish and grain to the <i>bopp&eacute;</i> or spirits invoked. There
were two kinds of <i>barih</i>: a superior one with abnormal
powers, and an inferior one. The <i>barih</i> eventually
pretended that the spirit had entered his body. He
then began to devour the food himself, in order to
appease the hunger of his internal guest and become
on friendly terms with him. The wife of the <i>barih</i>,
who on those occasions stood by his side, was generally
asked to partake of the meal, but only after the <i>barih</i>
had half chewed the various viands, when he gracefully
took them with his fingers from his own mouth and
placed them between the expectant lips of his better
half. She sometimes accepted them&mdash;sometimes not.
All according to her appetite, I suppose, and perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-225" id="Pg_1-225"></a>[<a href="images/1-225.png">225</a>]</span>
to the temporary terms on which she was that day with
her husband.</p>

<p>The Bororos, curiously enough, spoke constantly of
the hippopotamus&mdash;<i>ajie</i>, as they called it&mdash;and even imitated
to perfection the sounds made by that amphibious
animal. This was indeed strange, because the hippopotamus
did not exist in South America, nor has it ever
been known to exist there. The women of the Bororos
were in perfect terror of the <i>ajie</i>, which was supposed
to appear sometimes breaking through the earth.
Personally, I believed that the <i>ajie</i> was a clever ruse
of the Bororo men, in order to keep their women at
home when they went on hunting expeditions. Boys
were trained to whirl round from the end of a long
pole a rectangular, flat piece of wood attached to a
long fibre or a string. Its violent rotation round the
pole, with the revolutions of the tablet around itself
at different speeds, reproduced to perfection the sounds
of blowing and snorting of the hippopotamus. The
whizzing of this device could be heard at astonishing
distances. The credulous women were rendered absolutely
miserable when they heard the unwelcome
sounds of the <i>ajie</i>, and, truly believing in its approach,
retired quickly to their huts, where, shivering with
fright, they cried and implored to have their lives spared.</p>

<p>The boy who whirled the magic tablet was, of
course, bound to keep the secret of the <i>ajie</i> from the
women. Let me tell you that one of the chief
virtues of the Bororo men, old and young, was the
fidelity with which they could keep secrets. The
youngest children were amazing at keeping secrets even
from their own mothers. There were things that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-226" id="Pg_1-226"></a>[<a href="images/1-226.png">226</a>]</span>
Bororo women were not allowed to know. Boys
attended the tribal meetings of men, and had never
been known to reveal the secrets there discussed either
to their sisters or mothers.</p>

<p>When I said it was a virtue, I should have added
that that virtue was a mere development of an inborn
racial instinct. Young and old among the Bororo
were extremely timid and secretive by nature. They
feared everybody&mdash;they were afraid of each other.
It was sufficient to watch their eyes&mdash;ever roaming,
ever quickly attracted and pointing sharply at anything
moving anywhere around&mdash;to be satisfied of the
intense suspiciousness of these people.</p>

<p>The Bororos were restless nomads and could never
settle anywhere. They were always on the move&mdash;hunting,
fishing, and formerly on warlike expeditions
with other tribes. They showed great skill with their
arrows, which they threw with wonderful accuracy
even under conditions of unusual difficulty. When
fishing, for instance, they showed remarkable calculating
powers when the line of vision became deviated
by the surface of the water and made it difficult to
judge the exact position of the fish at different depths,
quite removed from where the eye saw it. Their long
arrows had a double-barbed bone head, which was
poisoned when fighting men.</p>

<p>The Bororos were not quarrelsome by nature; on
the contrary, they were dignified and gentle. They
always avoided fighting. It was only when driven to
it, or when hunted down and attacked, that they naturally
endeavoured to defend themselves. This has
brought upon them the reputation of being barbarous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-227" id="Pg_1-227"></a>[<a href="images/1-227.png">227</a>]</span>
and cruel savages. Even among themselves they
seldom quarrelled; they never offended one another
with words. They had great respect for their elders.</p>

<p>At night the men collected in the village. One of
them spoke aloud to the crowd, delivering a regular
lecture on the events of the day, their hunting or
fishing adventures, or tribal affairs. The greatest
attention was paid to the orator, and only after his
speech was over a warm but orderly discussion followed.</p>

<p>When a Bororo man was angry with another he
would not descend to vulgar language, but he generally
armed himself with a bony spike of that deadly fish,
the <i>raja</i> (<i>Rhinobates batis</i>) or <i>mehro</i>, as it was called
in the Bororo language, which he fastened to a wristlet.
With it he proceeded in search of his enemy, and on
finding him, inflicted a deep scratch upon his arm.
This was considered by the Bororos the greatest insult
a man could offer.</p>

<p>Women, as in most other countries, quarrelled more
than men. Not unlike their Western sisters, they
always&mdash;under such circumstances&mdash;yelled at the top
of their voices, and then resorted to the effective and
universal scratching process with their long sharp nails.</p>

<p>It will be judged from this that it will not quite
do to put down the Bororos as being as tame as lambs.
Indeed, it was sufficient to look at their faces to be
at once struck by the cruel expression upon them.
They prided themselves greatly on having killed
members of rival tribes, and more still upon doing
away with Brazilians. In the latter case it was pardonable,
because until quite recently the Brazilians have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-228" id="Pg_1-228"></a>[<a href="images/1-228.png">228</a>]</span>
slaughtered the poor Indians of the near interior regions
in a merciless way. Now, on the contrary, the Brazilian
Government goes perhaps too far the other way in its
endeavour to protect the few Indians who still remain
within the Republic.</p>

<p>The more accessible tribes, such as the insignificant
ones on the Araguaya, were having a good time&mdash;valuable
presents of clothes they did not want, phonographs,
sewing machines, fashionable hats, patent
leather shoes, automatic pistols and rifles being showered
upon them by expensive expeditions specially sent out
to them. It no doubt pleased an enthusiastic section
of the Brazilian public to see a photograph of cannibal
Indians before they met the expedition, without a
stitch of clothing upon their backs&mdash;or fronts to be
accurate&mdash;and by its side another photograph taken
half an hour later and labelled "Indians civilized and
honoured citizens of the Republic," in which you saw
the same Indians, five or six, all dressed up and, it may
be added, looking perfectly miserable, in clothes of the
latest fashion. It would have been interesting to
have taken a third photograph an hour after the second
picture had been taken, in order to show how soon
civilization&mdash;if donning a pair of trousers and shoes
and a collar and tie can be called being civilized&mdash;can
be discarded.</p>

<p class="fsc">Bororo Men.</p>
<p class="figcenter">(The aprons are not actually worn.)</p>
<hr />
<p>The news had spread by word of mouth down the
Araguaya many months ahead that a Brazilian expedition
would be sent out with gifts, in order to befriend
the Indians&mdash;supposed to be innumerable: only a few
dozens, all counted, in reality. Seeing no expedition
arrive, the Indians&mdash;five or six&mdash;proceeded to travel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-229" id="Pg_1-229"></a>[<a href="images/1-229.png">229</a>]</span>
some hundreds of miles to go and find it. The expedition
for lack of money had remained stuck in a certain
town. It was in that town that the valuable photographs
were taken. No sooner had they said good-bye
to their generous donors than the Indians left
the city, quickly removed their clothes, which they
exchanged for a few drinks of <i>aguardente</i> (fire-water),
and, as naked as before, returned to the shores of their
beloved river.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the movement of the Brazilian Government
was extremely praiseworthy and did it great
credit. Like all movements of that kind it was bound
to go to excesses in the beginning, especially in Brazil,
where people were very generous when they were
generous at all. So that so far the fault has been on
the right side. It will undoubtedly prevent in the
future much severe, even cruel treatment which has
been bestowed on the Indians.</p>

<p>It was only a great pity&mdash;a very great pity&mdash;that
this movement for the protection of the Indians had
been started when there were few pure Indians&mdash;almost
none&mdash;left to protect. According to Brazilian
statements, the wild Indians of Central Brazil amounted
to some fifteen or twenty millions or thereabouts! A
few&mdash;very few&mdash;thousands, perhaps only hundreds,
would be nearer the truth. There were no great tribes
left in their absolutely wild state anywhere in Brazil.
There were a few small tribes or families scattered here
and there, but it was seldom that these tribes numbered
more than twenty or thirty members. If the tribe
numbered fifty individuals it was already a large tribe.
Most of them contained merely six or eight members.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-230" id="Pg_1-230"></a>[<a href="images/1-230.png">230</a>]</span>
So that really, in the population of Brazil, these tribes,
instead of being the chief factor, were in fact a negligible
quantity. It would be rash to make a statement as to
the exact number of wild Indians in Brazil, for in a
country so big&mdash;larger, as I have already stated, than
the United States of America, Germany, Portugal, and a
few other states taken together&mdash;and most of which
was little known or absolutely unknown&mdash;it was not
easy to produce an exact census.</p>

<p>During my journey, which crossed that immense
country in a zigzag from one end to the other in its
broader width, and covered all the most important
regions of the Republic, I became assured that few
indeed were the pure Indians to be found in Central
Brazil. One went hundreds and hundreds of miles
without meeting signs of them; and that in localities
where they were supposed to be swarming. The
Bororos&mdash;a few dozens of them, all counted, in two or
three different subdivisions&mdash;were perhaps the strongest
wild tribe in all the immense State of Matto Grosso.</p>

<p>As I have said, I was greatly impressed, from my
first contact with the Bororos, by the strongly Polynesian
appearance of some of them. The more specimens
I saw of them the more I became convinced
that they were of the same race. In fact, more: I
began to speculate whether the people of Australia
and Polynesia had migrated here or whether it was
just the other way&mdash;which theory might also be
plausibly upheld&mdash;viz. that the people of Central South
America had migrated to the west, into Polynesia and
Australia. Many theories have been expounded of
how races always follow certain rules in their migrations,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-231" id="Pg_1-231"></a>[<a href="images/1-231.png">231</a>]</span>
but in my own experience I do not invariably find that
those theories are always correct. Again, it does not
do to rely too much on the resemblance of words in
establishing a relationship between two or more races.
Nor, indeed, can one trust absolutely to the resemblance
in the rudimentary ornamentation of articles of use.
If you happen to be a student of languages, and have
studied dozens of them, you will soon discover how far
words will travel across entire continents. They can
often be traced back to their origin by the knowledge
of intermediate languages through which, with distortions,
those words have passed. In Central Africa I
actually heard words of Mongolian origin, and not
only that, but even traced Mongolian characteristics in
the type of the ruling classes of natives, as well as
in the construction of their language.</p>

<p>It is easy to be occasionally misled. I remember
on my journey across Africa how amazed I was at
first at hearing some Tonkinese expressions used by
the native cannibals. I really could not get over my
amazement until I learnt that some years previously
a number of Tonkinese convicts had been sent up the
Congo and Ubanghi rivers by the French. Several of
them had lived in that particular village of cannibals
for some years. Hence the adoption of certain words
which had remained in frequent use, whereas the Tonkinese
individuals had disappeared.</p>

<p>I took special care in Brazil, when making a vocabulary
of the Bororo and other Indian languages, to select
words which I ascertained were purely Indian and had
not been contaminated either by imported Portuguese
words or words from any other language. I was much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-232" id="Pg_1-232"></a>[<a href="images/1-232.png">232</a>]</span>
struck by the extraordinary resemblance of many words
in the language of the Indians of Central Brazil to
the Malay language and to languages of Malay origin
which I had learnt in the Philippine Islands and the
Sulu Archipelago.</p>

<p>For instance: the Sun, which is called in Malay
<i>mata-ari</i>, usually abbreviated into <i>'ari</i>, was in the
Bororo language <i>metiri</i>, and in the language of the
Apiacar Indians of the Arinos-Juruena river, <i>ahra</i>, which
indeed closely resembles the Malay word. Moreover, the
word <i>ahri</i> in the Bororo language indicated the <i>moon</i>&mdash;a
most remarkable coincidence. It became slightly distorted
into <i>zahir</i> in the Apiacar language.</p>

<p>Water, which is <i>poba</i> in Bororo and <i>&uuml;ha</i> in Apiacar,
was curiously enough <i>&uuml;haig</i> in the Bagobo language
(Mindanao Island), <i>po-heh</i> or <i>bo-heh</i> in the Bajao
language (Mindanao Island), <i>ayer</i> in Malay, and <i>uhayeg</i>
in Tiruray (west coast of Mindanao Island, Philippine
Archipelago).</p>

<p>Father was <i>bapa</i> in Malay, and <i>pao</i> in Bororo.
Many were the words which bore a slight resemblance,
as if they had been derived from the same root. <i>Langan</i>,
arm, in Malay, was <i>ankan-na</i> or <i>akkan-na</i>. Ear, in the
Ilocano language (Philippine Archipelago) was <i>cabayag</i>;
<i>aviyag</i> in Bororo. Hair in Ilocano, <i>b&#335;&#335;k</i>, in Manguianes
<i>bohoc</i>, and in Sulu (Sulu Archipelago) <i>buhuc</i>; in Bororo
it was <i>akkao</i>, which might easily be a corruption of the
two former words.</p>

<p class="fsc">Bororo Warriors.</p>
<hr />
<p>I was greatly interested, even surprised, to find that
although those Indians lived thousands of miles on every
side from the sea, and had never seen it, yet they
talked of the <i>pobbo mae re u</i>&mdash;the immense water;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-233" id="Pg_1-233"></a>[<a href="images/1-233.png">233</a>]</span>
(<i>pobbo</i>, water; <i>mae</i>, great; <i>re</i>, the; <i>u</i>, an expression
of magnification such as our <i>oh</i>).</p>

<p>It was also interesting to note that they had specific
words for water of streams&mdash;words which we do not
possess in the English language, complete as our
language is&mdash;such as down-stream, and up- or against-stream&mdash;like
the French <i>en aval</i> and <i>en amont</i>. The
Bororo used <i>tche begki</i>, down-stream, and <i>tcheo bugkii</i>,
up-stream.</p>

<p>The Bororo language was rudimentary in a way,
yet most complete&mdash;extremely laconic, with innumerable
contractions. The construction of sentences and
the position of the verb were not unlike those of Latin
languages.</p>

<p>The chief wealth of the Bororo language consisted
in its nouns. Like all savage languages, it was
wonderfully rich in botanical and zoological terms.
The gender was formed by a suffix, the masculine differing
from the feminine.</p>

<p>There were in the Bororo language three genders,
masculine, feminine and neuter. The masculine was
formed by adding the words <i>chireu</i>, <i>curi</i>, or <i>curireu</i>, to
the noun; the feminine by the suffixes <i>chireuda</i> and
<i>curireuda</i>. There were many words which were used
unaltered for either gender. In the case of animals, the
additional words <i>medo</i>, male, or <i>aredo</i>, female, clearly
defined the sex in specific cases where the names would
otherwise be ambiguous. Inanimate objects had no
sex, and were therefore neuter.</p>

<p>Most nouns had a plural as well as a singular, but
there were exceptions to this rule, such as names of
certain plants and animals, the sky, the wind, etc.;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-234" id="Pg_1-234"></a>[<a href="images/1-234.png">234</a>]</span>
not to count things which were generally taken collectively,
such as flies&mdash;<i>ruque</i>; macaw or macaws, <i>nabure</i>,
etc.</p>

<p>The plural was made by the suffixes <i>doghe</i> or <i>maghe</i>&mdash;the
<i>maghe</i> being used principally in possessive cases,
such as <i>tori-doghe</i>, stones; <i>padje-maghe</i>, our mothers.
Exceptions to this rule were the words ending in <i>bo</i>, <i>co</i>,
<i>go</i>, or <i>mo</i>, to which the suffix <i>e</i> was sufficient to form
the plural; whereas in those terminating in <i>do</i> or <i>no</i>,
<i>ro</i>, or other consonants, the <i>o</i> was suppressed and an
<i>e</i> placed in its stead. Example: <i>jomo</i>, otter, <i>jomoe</i>,
otters; <i>cuno</i>, parrot, <i>cune</i>, parrots; <i>apodo</i>, or tucan (a
bird), <i>apode</i>, tucans, etc.</p>

<p>There were a number of irregular exceptions, such
as <i>aredo</i>, wife; <i>areme</i>, wives; <i>medo</i>, man, <i>ime</i>, men.
Perhaps the most curious of plurals was <i>ore</i>, sons, the
singular of which was <i>anareghedo</i> (son).</p>

<p>The words ending in <i>go</i> generally formed the plural
with an interchangeable <i>ghe</i>.</p>

<p>The pronouns were:</p>

<div class='centered'>
<table  class="toc" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Pronouns">
<tr><td align='left'><i>imi</i></td><td align='left'>=</td><td align='left'>I</td><td align='left'><i>sheghi</i> or <i>paghi</i></td><td align='left'>=</td><td align='left'>we</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'><i>aki</i></td><td align='left'>=</td><td align='left'>thou</td><td align='left'><i>taghi</i></td><td align='left'>=</td><td align='left'>you</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'><i>ema</i></td><td align='left'>=</td><td align='left'>he or she</td><td align='left'><i>emaghi</i></td><td align='left'>=</td><td align='left'>they</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>When immediately before a verb these were abbreviated
into <i>I</i> or <i>it</i>, <i>a</i> or <i>ac</i>, <i>e</i> or <i>ei</i>, <i>pa</i> or <i>pag</i>, ta or <i>tag</i>, <i>e</i> or <i>et</i>&mdash;I,
thou, he or she, we, you, they, according to their
preceding a vowel or a consonant. With words beginning
with a consonant only the first syllable of the
pronoun was used.</p>

<p>The verb itself did not vary in the various persons,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-235" id="Pg_1-235"></a>[<a href="images/1-235.png">235</a>]</span>
but it did vary in its tenses by suffixes, sometimes after
the pronoun, sometimes after the verb. In the present
tense the Bororos generally used for the purpose the
word <i>nure</i>, usually between the pronoun and the verb,
with the pronoun occasionally repeated after the
<i>nure</i>; but in general conversation, which was laconic,
the pronoun was frequently suppressed altogether&mdash;similarly
to the frequent omission of the pronoun in
the English telegraphic language.</p>

<p>There were various other forms of pronouns, but
I could not quite define their absolute use&mdash;such as
the <i>tched</i> or <i>tcheghi</i>, which seemed to include everybody,
corresponding to the English <i>we</i> in orations which
includes the entire audience, or the whole nation, or
even the entire human race.</p>

<p>The Bororo language was complete enough, the
conjugation of verbs being clearly defined into past,
present, imperative and future.</p>

<p>The past was formed by interpolating between
the pronoun and verb the words <i>re gurai</i>, generally
abbreviated into <i>re</i>. The imperative was made chiefly
by the accentuation of the words, and was susceptible
of inflexion in the second person singular and plural.
The future was formed by adding, sometimes after the
pronoun, sometimes after the verb, the words <i>modde</i>,
<i>uo</i>, or <i>ua</i>.</p>

<p>At the end of the second volume, in the Appendix,
will be found a vocabulary of useful words needed in
daily conversation which I collected during my visit
to the Bororos. I had made a much more complete
dictionary of their language, in a book which I kept
for the purpose, but unfortunately the book was lost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-236" id="Pg_1-236"></a>[<a href="images/1-236.png">236</a>]</span>
with a great many other things in an accident I had
some months later on the Arinos River.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was not possible to say that the Bororos shone
in intelligence. It was seldom one found an individual
who could count beyond two. Everything in the
Bororo country was reckoned in couples&mdash;with the
aid of fingers, thumbs, and toes. The learned could
thus reach up to twenty, or ten pair&mdash;but beyond
twenty no Bororo dared venture in his calculations.
They had no written language, no sculptures or paintings,
no carved idols. Their artistic talent seemed
limited to occasionally incising rudimentary representations
of horns, footprints, and line figures on rocks.</p>

<p>They showed great skill in the manufacture of
their arrows, which were indeed constructed on most
scientific lines, and were turned out with wonderful
workmanship. The arrows were from 4 to 5 ft. long,
and were chiefly remarkable for the intelligent and
highly scientific disposition of the two balancing
parrot feathers, gently bent into a well-studied spiral
curve, so as to produce a rotary movement, united
with perfect balance, in the travelling weapon. The
arrows were manufactured out of hard, beautifully
polished black or white wood, and were provided with
a point of bamboo one-third the length of the entire
arrow. That bamboo point was tightly fastened to
the rod by means of a careful and very precisely made
contrivance of split cane fibre.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill1-236.jpg"><img src="images/ill1-236_th.jpg" alt="Bororo Children." title="Bororo Children." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Bororo Children.</p>
<p class="figcenter">(The horrors of photography.)</p>
<hr />
<p>The Bororos used various-shaped arrow-heads,
some triangular, others flattened on one side with a
raised rib on the opposite side, others triangular in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-237" id="Pg_1-237"></a>[<a href="images/1-237.png">237</a>]</span>
section with hollowed longitudinal grooves in each
face of the triangle in the pyramid, making the wound
inflicted a deadly one. Others, more uncommon,
possessed a quadruple barbed point of bone.</p>

<p>The favourite style of arrows, however, seldom had
a point broader in diameter than the stick of the arrow.</p>

<p>The music of the Bororos&mdash;purely vocal&mdash;had three
different rhythms: one not unlike a slow waltz, most
plaintive and melancholy; the second was rather of
a loud warlike character, vivacious, with ululations and
modulations. The third and most common was a sad
melody, not too quick nor too slow, with temporary
accelerations to suit words of a more slippery character
in their pronunciation, or when sung in a <i>pianissimo</i>
tone.</p>

<p>The songs of the Bororos could be divided into:
hunting songs, war songs, love songs, and descriptive
songs and recitatives.</p>

<p>They were fond of music in itself, and possessed
fairly musical ears. They were able to retain and
repeat melodies quite foreign to them. Their
hearing was acute enough to discern, with a little
practice, even small intervals, and they could fairly
accurately hit a note which was sung to them. They
had flexible voices, quite soft and musical, even in
conversation.</p>

<p>In males, as far as I was able to judge, baritone
voices were the most prevalent; in female voices,
soprano. Their typical songs were chiefly performed
in a chorus by men only, although once or twice I
heard solos&mdash;which, nevertheless, always had a refrain
for the chorus. The Bororos sang in fair harmony<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-238" id="Pg_1-238"></a>[<a href="images/1-238.png">238</a>]</span>
more than in unison, keeping regular time, and with
occasional bass notes and noises by way of accompaniment.
They possessed no musical instruments of any
importance&mdash;a most primitive flute, and one or several
gourds filled with seeds or pebbles, being, as far as I
could trace, the only two musical instruments among
them.</p>

<p>Their songs contained progressions in chromatic
intervals. Those progressions were not only frequently
repeated in the same melody, but some of the favourite
ones recurred in several of their melodies. They
frequently broke from one key into another, not gradually
or with modulations, but very abruptly. There
were constant and sudden changes in the <i>tempo</i> of
their melodies, accelerations being frequently caused by
excitement in the performers, by incidents occurring,
by anger or other passions being aroused. They had
no set rules&mdash;nor, of course, any written music. The
melodies were sung according to the temporary feelings
of the performers, who occasionally adorned their performances
with variations. Practically they improvised,
if led by a musical talent, as they went along.
Still, mind you, even when they improvised, the
character of the songs was the same, although they
may have added so many variations and embellishments
to the theme as to make it impossible to identify them.
Furthermore, no two choruses ever sang the same
songs alike, nor did the same chorus sing the same song
twice alike. There were in their melodies great changes
in the degree of loudness. Those changes were generally
gradual, although often extremely rapid.</p>

<p>The Bororos seemed to be greatly carried away by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-239" id="Pg_1-239"></a>[<a href="images/1-239.png">239</a>]</span>
music, which had upon them quite an intoxicating
effect. There were certain high notes and chords in a
minor key which had a great attraction for them, and
which constantly recurred in their melodies and their
lengthy ululations. Some of the notes had undoubtedly
been suggested by the song of local birds and by sounds
of wild animals. The Bororos were good imitators
of sounds, which they could often reproduce to perfection.
They were observant with their ears&mdash;much
more so than with their eyes. Even in conversation
the Bororos would often repeat, accurately enough,
noises they heard around them, such as the crashing of
falling trees, of rushing water, of distant thunder, or
foreign words which caught their fancy. I was amazed
at their excellent memory in that direction.</p>

<p>There were no professional musicians in the Bororo
country in the strict sense of the word, the <i>barih</i> being
the only person who might, at a stretch, be put down
as one. Nor was anybody taught music. They were
one and all musicians without knowing it&mdash;or at least
thought they were&mdash;a belief not monopolized by the
Bororos only. They all sang. They learned to sing
gradually by hearing and imitating their elders.</p>

<p>I think that with the Bororos the steps of their
dances had been suggested by the rhythm of the music,
and not the other way round. They preferred music
to dancing, for which latter exercise they showed little
aptitude. Although their melodies would appear appallingly
melancholy to European ears, it did not
follow that they were so to them. On the contrary,
some which had a most depressing effect on me&mdash;and
I felt like throwing at them anything handy but heavy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-240" id="Pg_1-240"></a>[<a href="images/1-240.png">240</a>]</span>
to interrupt the melody&mdash;seemed to send the performers
into a state of absolute beatitude. They kept up
those melodies interminably, repeating constantly the
same short theme dozens of times&mdash;hundreds, in fact,
if nothing happened to stop them. When once they
had started on one of those songs it was difficult to
switch them on to another. They loved to hear it
again and again.</p>

<p>The time of their music was "common" time,
slightly modified according to the wording of the song.
It generally altered into a triple time when the words
were of a liquid kind in their pronunciation, and a
dual time when sung low and slowly.</p>

<p>When singing, especially during ululations, the
Bororos swung their bodies forward and backward&mdash;not
unlike the howling dervishes of Egypt&mdash;uttering
occasional high and strident notes. This was generally
done before starting <i>en masse</i> on a hunt, when a feast
also took place.</p>

<p>The women never joined in the songs, but the boys
did. Even if their voices were not powerful enough
to produce lengthy ululations, they spiritedly took part
in the violent undulations of the body.</p>

<p>The Bororos were great lovers of minute detail.
So it was that, in their music, strange, weird effects were
attempted, wonderfully complicated in detail.</p>

<p>Bororo singing occasionally took the form of a
recitative, with the chorus joining in the refrain&mdash;this
principally when chanting the merits of a deceased person,
or during some calamity in the <i>aldeja</i>, or village.</p>

<hr />
<p>The only musical instruments I was able to find in
the various settlements of Bororos I visited consisted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-241" id="Pg_1-241"></a>[<a href="images/1-241.png">241</a>]</span>
chiefly of single, double, or treble gourds, the latter
with perforations at the two ends, used as wind instruments
and producing deep bass notes. The single
gourd had a cane attachment intended to emit shrill
high notes. Then there were other dried gourds filled
with pebbles which rattled as they were shaken at the
end of a long handle to which the gourds were fastened.</p>

<p>The cane flutes were slightly more elaborate, with
ornaments of rings of black feathers. There was only
one rectangular slit in the centre of the flute, so that
only one note could be produced&mdash;as was the case with
most of their rudimentary musical instruments.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Bororo Legends&mdash;The Religion of the Bororos&mdash;Funeral Rites</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Bororos believed in spirits of the mountains and
the forest, which haunted special places in order to do
harm to living beings. Those spirits came out at night.
They stole, ill-treated, and killed. In rocks, said the
Bororos, dwelt their ancestors in the shape of parrots.
The Bororos were greatly affected by dreams and
nightmares, which they regarded as events that had
actually happened and which generally brought bad
luck. They were often the communications of evil
spirits, or of the souls of ancestors. The Bororos had
many superstitions regarding animals, which they
individualized in their legends, giving them human
intelligence&mdash;especially the <i>colibri</i> (humming-bird), the
macaw, the monkey, the deer, and the leopard.</p>

<p>The stars, according to these savages, were all
Bororo boys. Let me give you a strange legend concerning
them.</p>

<p>"The women of the <i>aldeia</i> had gone to pick Indian
corn. The men were out hunting. Only the old
women had remained in the <i>aldeia</i> with the children.
With an old woman was her nephew, playing with a
bow and arrow. The arrows had perforated sticks,
which the boy filled with Indian corn. When the boy
had arrived home he had asked his grandmother to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-243" id="Pg_1-243"></a>[<a href="images/1-243.png">243</a>]</span>
make a kind of <i>polenta</i> with Indian corn. He had invited
all the other boys of the <i>aldeia</i> to come and eat.
While grandmother was cooking the children played,
and among them decided to go to heaven. In the <i>aldeia</i>
there lived an old woman and a red macaw. Both could
speak. The boys, having eaten the <i>polenta</i>, cut off the
woman's arms, cut out her tongue and eyes, and tore
out the tongue of the speaking bird. Having done this,
they went into the forest, where they found a liana
twisted into innumerable steps (in the Bororo language,
<i>ippare</i>, young; <i>kugure</i>, multitude; <i>groiya</i>, step).
They could not speak for fear of drawing attention, nor
ask any one for help. They had taken the precaution
of setting free all the captive birds in the <i>aldeia</i>, and
they had flown away, except the <i>pio duddu</i> (the <i>colibri</i>),
which they took with them into the forest. The boys
gave a long liana, like a rope, to the <i>colibri</i>, requesting
him to fasten it to the top of the highest tree, and
another long liana which he must tie to the sky where
they all wished to ascend. The <i>colibri</i> tied the vegetable
ropes as requested, and all the boys climbed up.</p>

<p>"The mothers, missing their children, went to the
old woman and the speaking macaw.</p>

<p>"'Where are our children?' said they in a chorus.</p>

<p>"No answer. They were horrified when they perceived
the mutilated woman and bird. They rushed
out of the hut and saw the children&mdash;up&mdash;up&mdash;high,
like tiny spots, climbing up the liana to heaven. The
women went to the forest, to the spot where the boys
had proceeded on their aerial trip, and showing the
breasts that had milked them, entreated them to come
down again. The appeal was in vain. The mothers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-244" id="Pg_1-244"></a>[<a href="images/1-244.png">244</a>]</span>
in despair, then proceeded to follow their children skyward
up the liana.</p>

<p>"The youthful chieftain of the plot had gone up
last. When he perceived the mothers gaining on them,
he cut the liana. With a sonorous bump, the mothers
dropped in a heap to the ground. That was why the
Bororo women were resigned to see their sons in heaven,
forming the stars, while they&mdash;the women themselves&mdash;remained
the transmigrated souls of their mothers upon
earth."</p>

<p>The Bororos also said that the stars were the houses
of deceased children.</p>

<p>The Bororos believed that the sky vault, or heaven,
formed part of the earth, and was inhabited. They
proved this by saying that the vulture could be seen
flying higher and higher until it disappeared. It went
to perch and rest upon trees in heaven. The Milky
Way in the sky&mdash;the <i>kuyedje &egrave; 'redduddo</i> (literally translated
"stars they cinders")&mdash;consisted for them merely
of the flying cinders from the burning stars.</p>

<p>The sun, they stated, was made up entirely of dead
<i>barih</i>, or medicine-men, who rose daily with red-hot
irons before their faces. The <i>barihs</i> prowled about the
earth at night, and went to the east in the morning on
their return to the sun. The hot irons held by the
<i>barihs</i> were merely held in order to warm the people on
earth. At sunset the orb of day "came down to the
water" beyond the horizon, and from there marched
back to the east. The Bororos maintained that the
heavy and regular footsteps of the sun walking across
the earth at night could be heard plainly.</p>

the brother of the sun, and was similarly the home of
<i>barihs</i> of minor importance.</p>

<p>The legends of the Bororos were generally long and
somewhat confused. They were the outcome of extremely
imaginative and extraordinarily retentive minds.
Their imagination frequently ran away with them, so
that it was not always easy to transcribe the legends so
as to render them intelligible to the average reader,
unaccustomed to the peculiar way of thinking and
reasoning of savages. Yet there was generally a certain
amount of humorous <i>vraisemblance</i> in their most impossible
stories. Their morals, it should be remembered,
were not quite the same as ours. There were
frequently interminable descriptive details which one
could on no account reproduce in print, and without
them much of the point of the legends would be lost.
So that, with the confusion and disorder of ideas of the
Bororos, their peculiar ways of expression, and the
mutilation necessary so as not to shock the public,
the legends were hardly worth reproducing. Still, I
shall give here one or two of the more interesting
legends, which can be reproduced almost in their
entirety.</p>

<p>"The sun and moon (two brothers, according to
the Bororos) while hunting together began to play
with arrows with blunt heads, such as those used by
Bororos for catching birds alive. They hit each other
in fun, but at last the sun shot one arrow with too
much force and the moon died from the effects of the
wound. The sun, unconcerned, left his dying brother
and continued hunting; but afterwards returned with
medicinal leaves which he placed on the wound of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-246" id="Pg_1-246"></a>[<a href="images/1-246.png">246</a>]</span>
moon. According to Bororo fashion, he even covered
the dying brother entirely with leaves, when he saw
his approaching end. When he discovered that the
moon was dead he became frightened and left. That
is why the moon, which when alive was once as bright
as the sun, is now of less splendour. It is because it
is dead, and the sun is still alive."</p>

<p>The Bororos firmly believed that formerly the world
was peopled by monkeys. This was rather an interesting
legend, as it would point out that the Bororos, in
any case, were aware that the world was once inhabited
by a hairy race, which they called monkeys. It is
quite remarkable that a similar legend was found among
many of the tribes of the Philippine Islands and Sulu
Archipelago, and along the coast of the Eastern Asiatic
continent. The Bororos stated that they learnt from
monkeys how to make a fire. Monkeys were their
ancestors. The whole world was peopled by monkeys
in those days. Monkeys made canoes, too.</p>

<p>"One day a monkey and a hare went fishing together
in a canoe in which they had taken a good supply of
Indian corn. While the monkey was paddling the
hare was eating up all the corn. When the corn had
been entirely disposed of, in its irresistible desire to
use its incisors, the hare began to gnaw the sides of
the canoe. The monkey reprimanded the hare, and
warned it that the canoe would sink, and as the hare
was not a good swimmer it would probably get drowned,
or be eaten by fish which swarmed in the stream. The
hare would not listen to the advice, and continued in
its work of destruction. A hole was bored in the side
of the canoe, which promptly sank. The hare being a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-247" id="Pg_1-247"></a>[<a href="images/1-247.png">247</a>]</span>
slow swimmer&mdash;according to Bororo notions&mdash;was
immediately surrounded by swarms of <i>doviado</i> (gold
fish) and speedily devoured. The monkey&mdash;an excellent
swimmer&mdash;not only was able to save its life, but,
seizing a big fish, dragged it on shore.</p>

<p>"A jaguar came along and, licking its paws, asked
whether the monkey had killed the fish for its (the
jaguar's) dinner.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' said the monkey.</p>

<p>"'Where is the fire for cooking it?' replied the
jaguar.</p>

<p>"The sun was just setting. The monkey suggested
that the jaguar should go and collect some dried
wood in order to make the fire. The sun was peeping
through the branches and foliage of the forest. The
jaguar went, and returned with nothing; but in the
meantime the monkey, with two pieces of soft wood,
had lighted a fire and eaten the fish, leaving a heap
of bones. When the jaguar arrived the monkey leapt
in a few jumps to the top of a tree.</p>

<p>"'Come down!' said the jaguar.</p>

<p>"'Certainly not!' said the monkey. Upon which
the jaguar requested its friend the Wind to shake the
tree with all its fury. The Wind did, and the monkey
dropped into the jaguar's mouth, from which it immediately
passed into the digestive organs. The monkey
little by little moved its arms in the close quarters
in which it found itself, and was able to seize the knife
which it carried&mdash;in the most approved Bororo fashion&mdash;slung
across its back. Armed with it, it split the
jaguar's belly and resumed its daily occupation of
jumping from tree to tree."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-248" id="Pg_1-248"></a>[<a href="images/1-248.png">248</a>]</span>
I was able to record yet another strange legend on
the preservation of fire.</p>

<p>"An otter," said the legend, "in days long gone
by, had with great difficulty lighted a fire on the bank
of a river. The sun first came to warm itself by the
fire, and while the otter had gone on one of its aquatic
expeditions, the moon arrived too. The sun and moon
together, feeling in a mischievous mood, put out the
fire with water not extra clean. Then they ran for
all they were worth. The otter, feeling cold, came out
of the water and, to its amazement, found the fire had
been extinguished.</p>

<p>"'Who did it?' cried the furious otter, wishing
to kill whoever had put the fire out. While its anger
was at its highest the otter perceived a toad, which
was accused of extinguishing the fire because its legs
were as red as fire.</p>

<p>"'Do not kill me!' appealed the toad. 'Put your
feet on my belly.' The request was at once granted.
The toad opened its mouth wide, and with the pressure
of the otter's paws upon its body a burning coal was
ejected from its interior anatomy. The otter spared the
toad's life in recognition of its services in preserving
the fire. That is why the otter and the toad have
been friends ever since."</p>

<p>It was not easy to collect legends from the Bororos,
as only few of them were inclined to speak. The same
legend I found had many variations, according to the
more or less imaginative mind of the narrator.</p>

<p>Here is an extraordinary explanation of the origin
of lightning.</p>

<p class="fsc">Bororos showing Formation of Hands.</p>
<hr />
<p>"A boy had violated his own mother. His father,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-249" id="Pg_1-249"></a>[<a href="images/1-249.png">249</a>]</span>
discovering the misdeed and wishing to punish him
severely&mdash;in fact, get rid of the boy altogether&mdash;sent
him to several dangerous places to collect various things
for him, such as wild fruit, etc. The son, fearing disaster,
went to his grandmother for advice. She in
turn called first one bird and then another for their
advice. The father had sent his son to fetch some
small gourds (<i>bappo rogo</i>), which grew floating on or
suspended above the water of a lagoon. But the
lagoon was filled with the souls of deceased Bororos
and evil spirits. In the first instance the grandmother
begged for the help of the <i>pio duddo</i> (or <i>colibri</i>). This
obliging bird accompanied the boy to the lagoon and,
flying over the water, with its beak cut the twigs of
the small gourds, and one by one brought them to the
boy, who had wisely remained on dry land in order not
to be seized by the evil spirits which lay concealed in
the water. When the bird was about to bring the dried
gourds back, the seeds which were inside rattled and
aroused the evil spirits of the lagoon. Up they all
sprang&mdash;but the <i>colibri</i> was too swift for them, and the
gourds were safely delivered to the boy. The boy
brought them to his father, who, amazed at seeing his
son still alive, sent him next to fetch some large gourds&mdash;such
as those used by the <i>barih</i> at funerals and in
high ceremonies.</p>

<p>"The boy went once more to his grandmother, and
she this time recommended him to a dove (<i>metugo</i>).
When the dove and the boy arrived at the lake the
dove cut some large gourds, but, unfortunately, in so
doing made a noise. The souls and evil spirits of the
lake leapt out and dispatched numerous arrows to kill<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-250" id="Pg_1-250"></a>[<a href="images/1-250.png">250</a>]</span>
the dove, but, as luck would have it, dove and <i>bappo</i>
(gourds) escaped unhurt. The boy handed the large
gourds to his astounded father, who could not imagine
how the boy had escaped death a second time.</p>

<p>"The Bororos used in their dances the nails of
wild pigs, which they attached to their feet in order
to produce a noise something like castanets. That
ornament was called a <i>buttori</i>.</p>

<p>"The father next ordered his son to go and bring
back a complete set to form a <i>buttori</i>. For some reason
or other&mdash;according to the legend&mdash;the <i>buttori</i> was also
found suspended over the lagoon swarming with souls
and evil spirits. The grandmother on this occasion
advised the son to accept the services of a large, beautifully
coloured locust&mdash;called by the Bororos <i>mannori</i>.
The <i>mannori</i>, however, made so much noise while on
its errand that it became riddled with arrows from
the angry spirits of the lake. To this day, say the
Bororos, you can see a lot of white spots all over the
body of the <i>mannori</i>. Each marks the spot of a former
wound. But the <i>mannori</i>, too, faithfully delivered the
foot ornaments to the youth. The youth brought them
to his father, who, in amazement and vicious anger,
ordered his son to go with him on the mountain to
seize the nest of the <i>cibae</i> (vulture). According to the
notions of the Bororos, the souls of their dead trans-migrate
into the bodies of birds and other animals.</p>

<p>"The young fellow again paid a visit to his wise
grandmother, who was this time greatly upset. She
handed him a stick and requested him to insert it at
once into the vulture's nest, when they had arrived in
the hollow in the rock where the nest was. The boy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-251" id="Pg_1-251"></a>[<a href="images/1-251.png">251</a>]</span>
departed with his father up the precipitous mountain
side. When they had nearly reached the nest the
father placed a long stick across a precipice and ordered
his son to climb on it and seize the nest. The son duly
climbed&mdash;carrying with him his grandmother's stick.
When he had reached the top the father did all he
could to shake the son down into the chasm, and
even removed the long stick on which he had climbed.
But the lucky boy had already inserted his grandmother's
stick into the crevasse and remained suspended,
while the father&mdash;really believing that he had
at last succeeded in disposing of his son&mdash;gaily returned
to the <i>aldeia</i> (village). The son, taking advantage of
a liana festooned along the rock, was able to climb to
the very summit of the mountain. There, tired and
hungry, he improvised a bow and arrow with what
materials he could find, and killed some lizards. He
ate many, and hung the others to his belt. He went
fast asleep. With the heat, the fast decomposing
lizards began to smell. The odour attracted several
vultures, which began to peck at him, especially in the
softer parts behind (for he was sleeping lying on his
chest and face, as Bororos generally do). The boy
was too tired and worn to be awakened. The vultures
then seized him by his belt and arms, and, taking to
flight, soared down and deposited him at the foot of the
mountain. There the boy woke up, famished. His
supply of lizards had been eaten by the vultures. He
searched for fruit and ate some, but he could not
retain his food owing to injuries caused him by the
vultures. (Here a good portion of the legend has
to be suppressed.)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-252" id="Pg_1-252"></a>[<a href="images/1-252.png">252</a>]</span>
"As best he could, the boy went to look for the
<i>aldeia</i>, but it had vanished. He walked for several
days, unable to find traces of his tribe. At last he
found the footmarks which they had left upon their
passage. He followed them, and came to a fire freshly
made, left by the Indians. He went on until he
identified the footmarks showing where his grandmother
had gone. He made sure they were hers by
the extra mark of her stick on the ground. With the
assistance of a lizard, then of a big bird, then of a rat,
then of a butterfly, he discovered the whereabouts of
the old lady. He was by then an old man. Upon
perceiving his grandmother he again became a boy,
and hurried on&mdash;making a noise so that she might
know him again. She asked another nephew&mdash;'Look
and see who is behind!'&mdash;The nephew turned round
and recognized his eldest brother&mdash;who was also his
father. The grandmother embraced him tenderly.</p>

<p>"The eldest fellow persuaded his grandmother and
brother not to return to the <i>aldeia</i> where he had suffered
so much from the hands of his father.</p>

<p>"'They have made me suffer,' he said, 'and I shall
take my revenge. Come with me, and we shall all be
happy together.'</p>

<p>"They went to a beautiful spot. He climbed a
mountain, and from there proceeded to produce lightning,
thunder and wind, which exterminated the rest
of the tribe in the <i>aldeia</i>. That is why, when the
Bororos see lightning, they say that it is someone's
vengeance coming upon them."</p>

<hr />
<p>In the Bororo language, lightning was called
<i>boeru goddo</i> or "angry people"; thunder was <i>bai</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-253" id="Pg_1-253"></a>[<a href="images/1-253.png">253</a>]</span>
<i>gabe</i> when near, and <i>boya ruru</i>&mdash;or deaf sound&mdash;when
distant.</p>

<p>The Bororos related an interesting legend of a great
flood or deluge.</p>

<p>"One night a Bororo went with his bow and arrows
to the river in order to fish, at a spot where a cane snare
or trap had been made in the stream. He killed a
sacred fish. No sooner had he done this than the
water immediately began to rise. He was scarcely able
to get out of the water and run up the mountain side,
lighting his way with the torch of resinous wood he
had used in order to attract the fish while fishing.
The water kept almost overtaking him, it rose so rapidly.
He called out to the Bororos of his tribe to make their
escape, as the water would soon drown them, but they
did not believe him and consequently all except himself
perished. When he reached the summit of the mountain
he managed to light a big fire just before the rising
water was wetting the soles of his feet. He was still
shouting in vain to all the Bororos to run for their
lives. The water was touching his feet, when he
thought of a novel expedient. He began to remove
the red-hot stones which had lain under the fire and
threw them right and left into the water. By rapid
evaporation at the contact of the hot missiles, it is to
be presumed, as the legend does not say, the water
ceased to rise. In fact, the water gradually retired,
and the Bororo eventually returned to the spot where
he had left the tribesmen. All were dead. He went
one day into the forest and he found a doe&mdash;which
had in some mysterious way escaped death&mdash;and he
took her for his wife. From this strange union were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-254" id="Pg_1-254"></a>[<a href="images/1-254.png">254</a>]</span>
born children who were hornless and quite human,
except that they were very hairy. After a few generations
the hair entirely disappeared. That was how the
Bororo race was preserved."</p>

<p>That extraordinary legend was, to my mind, a very
interesting one&mdash;not in itself, but from several facts
which in its ignorant language it contained. First of
all, the knowledge of the Bororos concerning a former
hairy race&mdash;a hairy race referred to in legends found all
over the Eastern Asiatic coast and on many of the
islands in the Pacific from the Kuriles as far as Borneo.
Then it would clearly suggest a great deluge and flood
which most certainly took place in South America in
days long gone by, and was indeed quelled by burning
stones&mdash;not, of course, thrown by the hands of a
Bororo, from the summit of a mountain, but by a
great volcanic eruption spitting fire and molten rocks.</p>

<p>As I have stated elsewhere, there was every possible
indication in Central Brazil that torrential rains on an
inconceivable scale&mdash;naturally followed by unparalleled
floods&mdash;had taken place, in the company of or followed
by volcanic activity on a scale beyond all imagination.
One had only to turn one's head round and gaze at
the scenery almost anywhere in Central Brazil, but in
Matto Grosso particularly, to notice to what extent
erosion and volcanic activity had done their work.</p>

<p>Another curious belief of the Bororos was worth
remembering. They claimed that men and women did
not come from monkeys, but that once upon a time
monkeys were human and could speak. They lived
in huts and slept in hammocks.</p>

<p>The Bororos possessed no geographical knowledge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-255" id="Pg_1-255"></a>[<a href="images/1-255.png">255</a>]</span>
Beyond their immediate neighbourhood they knew of
no other place, and did not in any way realize the
shape or size of the earth.</p>

<p>They called themselves <i>Orari nogu doghe</i>&mdash;or people
who lived where the <i>pintado</i> fish (<i>orari</i> in Bororo) was
to be found. The Bororos spoke of only three other
tribes: the <i>Kaiamo doghe</i> (the Chavantes Indians),
their bitter enemies; the <i>Ra rai doghe</i>&mdash;the long-legged
people&mdash;ancient cave-dwellers, once the neighbours
of the Bororos, but now extinct; and the <i>Baru
gi raguddu doghe</i>&mdash;a name better left untranslated&mdash;applied
to a tribe living in grottoes.</p>

<p>In the way of religion the Bororos admitted of five
different heavens, in the last of which dwelt a Superior
Being&mdash;a deity called the <i>Marebba</i>. Marebba's origin
was unknown to the Bororos. All they knew was that
he had a mother and a powerful son. Marebba only
looked after the men&mdash;but he was so occupied that when
the <i>barihs</i>&mdash;through whose mediation it was possible to
communicate with him&mdash;wished to be heard, they had
to shout at the top of their voices in order to attract
his attention. Only the higher <i>barihs</i> could communicate
with him, the lower <i>barihs</i> being merely permitted
to communicate with his son.</p>

<p>They also believed in the existence of a bad god&mdash;an
evil spirit called <i>Boppe</i>. Boppe inhabited the mountains,
the tree-tops and the "red heaven." There
were many <i>boppe</i>, male and female, and to them were
due all the misfortunes which had afflicted the Bororos.
Some of the <i>barihs</i> maintained that they had actually
seen both Marebba and some of the <i>boppes</i>. They
gave wonderful descriptions of them, comparing them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-256" id="Pg_1-256"></a>[<a href="images/1-256.png">256</a>]</span>
in their appearance to human beings. The Bororos
believed that in any food it was possible to find a
<i>boppe</i>&mdash;there established in order to do evil. Therefore,
before partaking of meals, especially at festivals, they
first presented the <i>barih</i> with fruit, grain, meat and fish
in order to appease the anger of the evil spirits.</p>

<p>The Bororos believed in the transmigration of the
soul into animals. They never ate deer, nor jaguar,
nor vultures, because they thought that those animals
contained the souls of their ancestors. The jaguar, as
a rule, contained the soul of women. When a widower
wished to marry a second time he must first kill a
jaguar in order to free the soul of his first wife from
suffering.</p>

<p>They also seemed to have an idea that the <i>aru&eacute;</i>, or
souls of the dead, might reappear in the world and
could be seen by relatives. Men and women all became
of one sex on leaving this world&mdash;all souls being feminine,
according to the Bororos.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill1-256a.jpg"><img src="images/ill1-256a_th.jpg" alt="Bororos Thrashing Indian Corn." title="Bororos Thrashing Indian Corn." /></a></p>

<p class="fsc">A Bororo Blind Woman.</p>
<hr />
<p>The apparition of the souls before their relatives
was, of course, merely a clumsily arranged trick of the
<i>barihs</i>. This is how it was done. They made a circle
of branches of trees&mdash;in order to keep the audience at
a distance&mdash;and then erected a large wooden gate, so
arranged that when the souls appeared it fell down in
order to give them free passage. The souls&mdash;generally
not more than two together&mdash;upon being called by
the <i>barih</i>, entered the ring with their faces covered and
hopping with a special step of their own. They did
not respond to prayers or tears, and kept on twirling
about within the ring. The body was that of a woman,
wearing from the waist down a gown of palm leaves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-257" id="Pg_1-257"></a>[<a href="images/1-257.png">257</a>]</span>
The face was covered by a mask of vegetable fibre which
allowed its owner to see and not be seen. Upon the
head was worn a cap of wax in which were stuck a great
number of arrows, so that it looked just like the back
of a disturbed porcupine.</p>

<p>Naturally those "souls" were merely special girls
dressed up for the occasion. But credulous Bororo
women believed they were actually seeing the souls of
their dead relatives. They worked themselves into a
great state of excitement.</p>

<p>The same implement which was employed by the
Bororos to reproduce the sound of the <i>aigi</i> or <i>ajie</i>
(hippopotamus)&mdash;a board some ten inches long and
three inches wide attached to a string and revolved
from a long pole&mdash;was also used by them to announce
the departure of souls from this world to the next.
The women were ordered to cover their faces or hide
altogether inside their huts when these noises were
produced. Should one be curious enough to inquire
into their origin and look, she was generally condemned
to death&mdash;frequently by starvation. The Bacururu&mdash;or
the Coroado Indians&mdash;believed that, after such an
indiscretion, nothing could save the life of a woman.</p>

<p>Before starting on a hunting or fishing expedition
prayers were offered to the souls of the departed, so
that they might not interfere with the success of the
expedition, and if possible help instead.</p>

<p>The funeral rites of the Bororos were singular. On
the death of a man, a chorus of moans began and tears
were shed in profusion, while some one sang for several
days the praises of the defunct in a melancholy monotone.
The body was covered for two entire days,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-258" id="Pg_1-258"></a>[<a href="images/1-258.png">258</a>]</span>
during which all articles that belonged to the deceased,
such as bow and arrows, pots, and musical instruments,
were smashed or destroyed. The d&eacute;bris was stored
behind a screen in the hut, where subsequently was
also kept the hearse in which the body was conveyed to
the burial spot. The body, wrapped in a palm-leaf
mat, was then interred in a shallow oval grave just
outside his hut. A wooden beam was placed directly
over the body, and then the hollow was covered over
with some six or eight inches of earth. A few branches
of trees and some thorns were thrown over it to indicate
the spot.</p>

<p>For twenty days in the evening and night moans
resounded through the air. More tears were shed by
the relatives and by the <i>barih</i>, who frequently proceeded
to the grave to pour water on it. On the twentieth day,
while some one set at play the awe-inspiring revolving
board, others proceeded to exhume the body&mdash;by then
in a state of absolute decomposition. The remains
were taken to the stream and the bones cleaned with
great care. The skull was placed within two inverted
hemispherical baskets, whereas all the other bones of
the body were heaped into a third concave basket of
a larger size.</p>

<p>It was on their return&mdash;with moans and chanting&mdash;to
the <i>bayto</i>, or meeting-place in the <i>aldeia</i>, that the
most touching scene ensued. The skull was decorated
with a design of coloured feathers, while those present
inflicted wounds upon their own bodies, shedding blood
upon the basket of remains. The women, moreover,
tore one by one each hair from their heads and bodies
in sign of mourning.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-259" id="Pg_1-259"></a>[<a href="images/1-259.png">259</a>]</span>
After this the skull and bones were placed within
another basket, and were either cremated or thrown
to the bottom of a river. The property of the deceased
was then set ablaze.</p>

<p>I noticed in a hut a skirt made of long palm leaves.
It was donned at funerals. There were also several
long rudimentary flutes, formed by a cane cylinder
with a rounded mouthpiece inserted into another.
These flutes, too, were used only on such mournful
occasions.</p>

<p>The <i>barih</i> received a present from relatives at the
death of individuals in the tribe. The family remained
in mourning from five to six months. The widow, at
the death of her husband, was expected to tear each
hair off her scalp, one by one, until her head remained
as bald as a billiard-ball. She generally did it.</p>

<p>The corpses of women were treated slightly differently.
When a woman died she was buried <i>pro tem.</i>
A feast was given to the tribe. The process of denudation
having been given ample time to leave her
skeleton clean, her bones were collected, and placed in
a special basket and then cremated. The ashes were
scattered to the winds, and so were all her clothes,
ornaments, chattels, smashed to atoms, and articles of
food. Even fowls, if she possessed any, were destroyed.
Usually they were eaten by her friends.</p>

<p>The Bororos did not possess a sense of honour resembling
ours. Theft was not considered dishonourable,
and was not looked down upon nor condemned by
them. If a Bororo liked anything belonging to any one
else, they could see no reason why he should not
appropriate it. That was their simple way of reasoning,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-260" id="Pg_1-260"></a>[<a href="images/1-260.png">260</a>]</span>
and as no police existed among them such theories were
easily followed.</p>

<p>Taking something belonging to a stranger was, in
fact, rather encouraged, and in our experience we had
to keep a sharp watch when Indians came to our camp,
as things disappeared quickly. They seldom took the
trouble to ask for anything; they just took it and ran
away.</p>

<p>The measurements of Bororo heads in the table on
page <a href="#Pg_1-261">261</a>, taken, as an average, from several of the most
characteristic types, will be found of interest, especially
when compared with some from Papuan and Malay
tribes of the Philippine and Sulu Archipelagoes with
whom they have many points in common.</p>

<p>Due allowance must be made for the artificial deformation
of the cranium in the case of the Bororos.</p>

<p>I had no end of trouble in obtaining these measurements,
as the Bororos would not hear of being
measured. They were frightened of the nickel-plated
calliper I used for the purpose. It was quite beyond
them to understand why any one should want to know
the length of their noses. In fact, although many, after

taken, few of them would let me measure the nose.
None at all would permit me to measure the length of
their eyes, as they feared I should intentionally blind

I was able to add to the curious information already

especially at the forehead and back, so as to
flatten it and produce an abnormal shape of the skull.
In many cases only the back of the head was flattened
by the application of artificial pressure. The elongation
was both upwards and sideways. This deformation
was particularly confined to male children.</p>

<p>When twins were born one was killed or else left
to die in the sun, as they believed that the other could
not live if both were left alive. Murder for them, in
that instance, was a question of humanity.</p>

<p>The Bororos had a perfect horror of natural death.
They were terrified at the sight of a person dying.
Therefore when one of their people was about to expire
they covered him up and placed him out of sight. If
he or she under those circumstances delayed in departing
this life, the departure was hastened by suffocation
or strangulation. The Bororos were too restless, and
could not wait too long for anything.</p>

<p>They were easily suggestionized. Many of them
would make excellent subjects for hypnotic experiments.
The women particularly were extraordinarily
sensitive to animal magnetism. They were much
given to hysterical displays. One of the reasons
which was given me for hastening the death of
moribund Bororos was a curious superstition that the
sight of a dying person would cause the death of women,
particularly if the dying person happened to look in
the direction of one woman present. The women
believed this so firmly that occasionally&mdash;the Bororos
asserted&mdash;women actually became ill and died when
they saw a dead person. This, no doubt, may have
occurred merely by suggestion. Women were never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-263" id="Pg_1-263"></a>[<a href="images/1-263.png">263</a>]</span>
allowed, under ordinary circumstances, to see dead
people.</p>

<p>When dancing the Bororos sprang on one foot and
then on the other, always hopping about in a circle.</p>

<p>Abnormalities and deformities were frequently
noticeable among them, such as hare-lip, supernumerary
toes and fingers, and hypertrophy of the limbs. Abnormalities
of the genitals were general owing to tribal
customs.</p>

<p>One of the evil spirits most feared by the Bororos
was called <i>aroi koddo</i>&mdash;or "soul that falls." It was a
spirit that came to earth solely for the purpose of
punishing the Bororos. They said that this spirit
was an extremely noisy one and its approach was
announced by terrifying sounds.</p>

<p>The Bororos were frightened of comets and had
about them superstitions similar to those of Europeans&mdash;that
is to say, that their appearance caused illness,
misfortune and death. Solar and lunar eclipses, the
Bororos stated, were merely the result of anger on the
part of evil spirits. "The sun or moon were making
faces because they were angry," was their highly astronomical
explanation of the phenomenon.</p>

<p>The Bororos had a firm belief that some of their
ancestors lived in the sun, others in the moon; and
they said the ancestors caused the sun to make faces
when angry. In the sun also lived the head of all
the <i>barihs</i>, or medicine-men, the intermediary between
humans and spirits; whereas in the moon dwelt only
those who could invoke the souls of the ancestors.
The <i>barih</i> was only capable of communicating with a
<i>barih's</i> ancestors.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The River Das Gar&ccedil;as&mdash;Majestic Scenery</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">I went</span> to call on the Salesian Fathers. Between my
camp and the river Das Gar&ccedil;as, on the right bank of
which the colony stood, there was a great dome of red
volcanic rock with many loose boulders such as we
had seen for the last three days of our journey. The
river was swift and deep. The colony was on the
opposite side of the water. We shouted until an Indian
appeared and took us across in a rickety canoe belonging
to the friars, which he paddled with the stalk of a palm-leaf.</p>

<p>The Salesians were remarkable people, and should
be an example to many other missionaries. Wherever
they went they did not trouble much about making
converts. They taught the natives instead how to
work the soil and how to make all kinds of articles
which might or might not be useful to them as they
became more civilized. The chief effort of the monks
was to teach the natives agriculture, from which&mdash;charity
always begins at home&mdash;the friars themselves
were naturally the first to reap the benefit. At the
same time the natives learned, and earned, and were
made happy. They improved their mode of living and
were, with great softness and patience, not only drawn
nearer to Catholicism but towards white people alto<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-265" id="Pg_1-265"></a>[<a href="images/1-265.png">265</a>]</span>gether.
The Salesians had established on the Rio das
Gar&ccedil;as&mdash;an enchanting spot&mdash;a beautiful farm on
which they grew quantities of Indian corn, sugar-cane,
wheat, and all kinds of vegetables.</p>

<p>Although I am not a Roman Catholic, the Salesians
received me very politely and took the greatest delight
in showing me all over the Mission. It was interesting
to note that everybody was working hard. The Father
Superior himself was busy shaping a big table from a
huge plank of hard wood, and nothing could induce
him to leave his sweating work&mdash;not even to go and have
his meals. Father Colli Agostino was detailed to go
round and explain everything to me.</p>

<p>The Salesians had no trouble with the Indians,
whom they found quite gentle and docile. But they
could never be relied upon. One day the entire tribe
would come and help to work the soil with great vigour;
the next day they would all disappear from the neighbourhood
and no one knew where they had gone&mdash;sometimes
for weeks. They invariably came back,
sooner or later, and, what was more, they were always
welcomed back.</p>

<p>Converting them to Christianity was a different
matter. The Salesians had made little headway in that
direction.</p>

<p>"We are patient people," said Father Colli; "it
will come in time. Already the Bororos are beginning
to join us in the church, where many enjoy singing with
us. They are intelligent and soon learn to sing."</p>

<p>I purchased, at almost prohibitive prices, many
things from the Salesians, principally food for my
animals and men. Of course, in buying one had to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-266" id="Pg_1-266"></a>[<a href="images/1-266.png">266</a>]</span>
realize where we were, which made all the difference in
the price. I was glad to pay them the money and obtain
the commodities.</p>

<p>The Salesians told me that while digging to make
the foundations for one of their buildings they had
found&mdash;only 3 ft. under ground&mdash;in the sandy soil
several earthen pots of great antiquity, in excellent
preservation, as well as a fireplace with ashes and
charcoal. The sand had evidently accumulated in the
valley below there owing to wind and not to water.
The frail pottery, imperfectly baked, would have
crumbled away quickly in moisture.</p>

<p>On May 20th (min. 58&deg; Fahr., max. 85&deg;) we were
again off toward the west, travelling over great domes
of red lava, the higher portions of which were covered
by layers of ashes and red sand. We were at an elevation
of 1,480 ft. in the deep basin of the Rio Barreiros
and Rio das Gar&ccedil;as, but we soon went over three
consecutive ridges, 1,550 ft. above the sea level, with
delicious campos and a <i>bosquet</i> of trees here and there.
In the arc of a circle extending from north-west to
south-west we had in front of us a beautiful view.
Previous to reaching the third ridge, that day, we also
had behind us a wonderful panorama of the great
plateau described in a previous chapter.</p>

<p>On travelling over a fourth elevation we found ourselves
upon another immense dome of red volcanic
rock, blackened on the surface, as if by fire, and with
the peculiar striations we had noticed once or twice
before. In this case there were cross striations as well,
the direction of one set of parallel marks being from
north-west to south-east, of the other set north-east to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-267" id="Pg_1-267"></a>[<a href="images/1-267.png">267</a>]</span>
south-west, thus forming lozenges, each about 60 cm.
across. All those lozenges were so regularly cut that
the <i>ensemble</i> gave the appearance of a well-made pavement.
Then I noticed some peculiar great cavities
in the rock, like those formed by glacial action. In
fact, on a superficial examination, it seemed almost as
if that region had first gone through a period of great
revolution while in a state of semi-liquefaction owing
to intense heat from fire, after which a sudden and
intense cooling had taken place and covered the country
perhaps even with ice. Whether the immense deposits
of ashes and sand had been formed before or after the
glacial period&mdash;if any such period ever existed in that
particular region&mdash;could be merely a matter of speculation.
In many places the sand, ashes, and red earth
had almost consolidated into easily friable rock.</p>

<p>Where the actual rock was not exposed we had
campos, campos, campos, stretching as far as the eye
could see. Far from being monotonous, one had&mdash;or
at least I had&mdash;a delightful sensation in riding across
those interminable prairies of beautiful green. One
could breathe the pure air with fully expanded lungs,
and in that silent, reposeful solitude one felt almost
as if the whole world belonged to one. We were not
much worried by insects on those great open places;
it was only on getting near patches of vegetation and
near streams that we suffered from the attacks of those
pests.</p>

<p>We saw few trees&mdash;all stunted and weak&mdash;as the
padding of earth over the rocky under-strata did not
permit their roots to go deep down, and therefore they
grew up with difficulty and an&aelig;mic.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-268" id="Pg_1-268"></a>[<a href="images/1-268.png">268</a>]</span>
Twelve kilometres from the Rio Barreiros we came
to a stream (elev. 1,400 ft.). On our left, rising above
the inclined campos, was a triple undulation much
higher than its neighbours. To the west stood two
twin, well-rounded mounds, that my men named at
once "the woman's breasts," which they much resembled.</p>

<p>We were still marching on deep deposits of ashes,
and, higher, upon semi-hardened sandstone. On the
northern side the twin hills had a different shape.
They ended in a sharply pointed spur.</p>

<p>After going over an ochre-coloured sandy region
(elev. 1,530 ft. above the sea level) we were again on
magnificent undulating campos, dotted here and there
with dark green shrubs and <i>bosquets</i> to the north, north-west,
and north-east.</p>

<p>Beyond, to the north-east, loomed again in the far
distance our mysterious plateau, of a pure cobalt blue
where in shadow. As one ran one's eye along its sky-line
it was almost flat for more than half its length,
then came a slight dip, followed by a terraced dome.
Then again a straight line followed by a slightly higher
and more undulating sky-line with three steps in it,
and a conical end at its eastern terminus. The most
easterly point of all&mdash;the highest&mdash;resembled a castle
with vertical sides. But of this we have already spoken,
at the terminal point of the great divided range we had
passed some days previously. The vertical cliffs of the
plateau, where lighted by the sun, were of a brilliant
red colour.</p>

<p class="fsc">The Endless Campos of Matto Grosso.</p>
<hr />
<p>As we approached the twin hills they appeared to
be the remains of an ancient crater. They formed, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-269" id="Pg_1-269"></a>[<a href="images/1-269.png">269</a>]</span>
fact, a crescent with a broken rocky lower section&mdash;completing
the circle of the crater. I had no time to
go and examine carefully, as it would have meant a
deviation from my route, but that is how it appeared to
me. There were, in fact, extra deep deposits of volcanic
ashes at the foot of the descent before we arrived at
the river Agua Emeindada, where we made our camp
that night, 15 kil. from the Rio Barreiros.</p>

<p>My men went after game that night. Alcides killed
a <i>veado</i> (deer), and we all enjoyed the fresh meat for
dinner.</p>

<p>The clouds (cirro-stratus) were, during the entire
day, in horizontal lines and slight globular accumulations,
the latter in a row and, taken <i>en masse</i>, giving also
the impression of lines just above the horizon to the
west. At sunset we once more saw the glorious effect
of the radiation from the west, only instead of being
straight lines there were, that time, feathery filaments
which rose in graceful curves overhead, like so many
immense ostrich feathers. They joined again in a
common centre to the east.</p>

<p>My men were complaining all the time of the intense
cold at night, and made me feel almost as if I had been
responsible for it. They grumbled perpetually. During
the early hours of the morning their moans were incessant.
They never ceased crying, as hysterical young
girls might do, but as one would not expect of men.
Some of them had toothache&mdash;and no wonder, when
one looked at their terrible teeth and the way they ate.
They devoured pounds of sugar every day&mdash;our supply,
which should have lasted a year or more, having already
almost been exhausted. It was impossible for me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-270" id="Pg_1-270"></a>[<a href="images/1-270.png">270</a>]</span>
alone, with all the astronomical, geological, botanical,
geographical, meteorological, photographic, anthropometric,
and artistic work&mdash;not to mention the writing-up
of my copious daily notes&mdash;also to keep a constant
watch on the supplies. I had handed over that responsibility
to Alcides. Unfortunately, he was the greediest
of the lot. Every time I warned him not to be so
wasteful, as we should find ourselves dying of starvation,
he and the others made me feel that I was meanness
itself, and that I was only doing it to save money.</p>

<p>I never objected to their eating as much as they
could&mdash;as I have always made it a point on all my
expeditions to feed my men on the best food procurable,
and give them as much as they could possibly devour.
But it pained me to see quantities of good food thrown
away daily, as I knew what it would mean to us later on.</p>

<p>"We are Brazilians," said they, "and like plenty
to eat. When there is no more we will go without food.
You do not know Brazilians, but Brazilians can go
thirty or forty days without anything to eat!"</p>

<p>"All right," said I&mdash;"we shall see."</p>

<p>Forty minutes&mdash;and perhaps not so long&mdash;had been,
so far, the longest time I had seen them cease munching
something or other. Not satisfied with the lavish
food they were supplied with&mdash;heaps of it were always
thrown to the dogs, after they had positively gorged
themselves&mdash;yet they would pick up anything on the
way: a wild fruit, a scented leaf of a tree, a nut of some
kind or other, a <i>palmito</i>, a chunk of tobacco&mdash;all was
inserted in the mouth. It was fortunate that we
took enough exercise, or surely they would have all
perished of indigestion. In my entire experience I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-271" id="Pg_1-271"></a>[<a href="images/1-271.png">271</a>]</span>
never seen men eat larger quantities of food and more
recklessly than my Brazilian followers did. In the
morning they were almost paralyzed with rheumatism
and internal pains all over the body. Frequently those
pains inside were accentuated by the experiments they
made in eating all kinds of fruit, some of which was
poisonous. Many a time on our march did we have to
halt because one man or another was suddenly taken
violently ill. My remedy on those occasions was to
shove down their throats the end of a leather strap,
which caused immediate vomiting; then when we were
in camp I gave them a powerful dose of castor oil.
After a few hours they recovered enough to go on.</p>

<p>On May 21st the minimum temperature of the
atmosphere was 55&deg; Fahr., the maximum 79&deg;, the
elevation 1,250 ft. at the stream Agua Emeindata. My
men declared again they were half-frozen during the
night and would not go on with me, as it was getting
colder all the time and they would certainly die. When
I told them that it was not cold at all&mdash;on the contrary,
I considered that temperature quite high&mdash;they would
not believe me.</p>

<p>With the temperature in the sun during the day at
98&deg;, most of the aches of the men disappeared, and I
had little trouble with them until after sunset, when
there was generally a considerable drop in the temperature.</p>

<p>We went on. We had a volcanic mountain to the
left of us&mdash;half the crater of a volcano formed of red
lava and friable red-baked rock. In the northern and
central part of the mountain were masses of lava which
had been shot out of the mouth of the volcano and had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-272" id="Pg_1-272"></a>[<a href="images/1-272.png">272</a>]</span>
solidified into all kinds of fantastic forms, some sharply
pointed, some red, others black. On the east side of
the crater was a dome covered with earth with an underlying
flow of lava. Then could be observed a circular
group of huge rocks, pear-shaped, with sharp points
upward. While the volcano was active these rocks
had evidently stood on the rim of the then cylindrical
crater. The mountain behind those rocks was formed
by high accumulations of red volcanic sand, which in
time had gradually, by the action of rain and sun,
consolidated into soft rock.</p>

<p>The plateau extending northward, which was disclosed
in all its entirety before me from the elevation
of 1,600 ft. which we had reached, also seemed to
possess an extinct crater shaped like a crescent with
steep slopes and two rounded promontories on its
side.</p>

<p>The sky that day was partly covered by transparent
feathery clouds and by dense mist near the horizon
line to the east, but was quite clear to the west. As
usual, that evening we were again treated to fairly
handsome radiating white lines from the sun reaching
half way up the sky vault, but this time they were
flimsy and not to be compared to the magnificent displays
we had observed before.</p>

<p>Our animals still sank in ochre-coloured sand, or
stumbled on conglomerate rocks of spattered lava
pellets embedded in sandstone. Capping the higher
undulations we again found deposits of ashes.</p>

<p class="fsc">Geometrical Pattern on the Surface of a flow of Lava.</p>
<p class="figcenter">(Caused by sudden contraction in cooling.)</p>
<hr />
<p>We travelled for long distances on a ridge at an
elevation of 1,650 ft. over a thick layer of sand and
ashes mixed. Then campos spread before us, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-273" id="Pg_1-273"></a>[<a href="images/1-273.png">273</a>]</span>
upon them here and there grew stunted vegetation,
the trees seldom reaching a greater height than 15 ft.</p>

<p>From our last high point of vantage the crater with
fantastic rocks and its continuation we had observed
appeared to form a great basin. A subsidiary vent was
also noticeable. Farther on our march we found other
immense deposits of grey ashes and sand alternately&mdash;one
great stretch particularly, at an elevation of
1,600 ft. Water at that spot filtered through from
underneath and rendered the slope a grassy meadow
of the most refreshing green. We were rising all the
time, first going north-west, then due north. At noon
we had reached the highest point.</p>

<p>From the high point on which we were (1,920 ft.)
we obtained a strange view to the west. Above the
straight line of the plateau before us rose in the distance
a pyramidal, steep-sided, sharply-pointed peak, standing
in solitary grandeur upon that elevated plain. Why
did it stand there alone? was the question one asked
oneself&mdash;a question one had to ask oneself frequently
as we proceeded farther and farther on our journey.
We often came upon mountains standing alone, either
on the top of table-lands or in the middle of extensive
plains. Their presence seemed at first unaccountable.</p>

<p>Again as we journeyed onward the mules' hoofs
were injured by treading over large expanses of lava
pellets and sharp-edged, cutting, baked fragments of
black rock, myriads of which also lay embedded in
reddish half-formed rock or buried in layers of yellowish-red
earth.</p>

<p>To the north was a majestic panorama of the most
delicate tones of blue and green, with almost over-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-274" id="Pg_1-274"></a>[<a href="images/1-274.png">274</a>]</span>powering
sweeping lines hardly interrupted by a slight
indentation or a prominence rising above the sky-line.
Only to the north-west in the middle distance was
there the gentle undulating line of magnificent campos&mdash;most
regular in its curves, which spread in a
crescent toward the west. The line was interrupted
somewhat abruptly by a higher and irregular three-terraced
mass, but soon resumed its sweeping and
regularly curved undulations beyond. This great
crescent almost described a semicircle around the
smaller undulations over which we were travelling.</p>

<p>We descended to 1,750 ft. On facing west we had
curious scenery on our left (south). A huge basin had
sunk in&mdash;evidently by a sudden subsidence which had
left on its northern side high vertical cliffs supporting
the hill-range that remained standing. The undulating
centre and sides of the immense depression formed
beautiful campos with an occasional <i>bosquet</i> of forest
on the top of hills, and also on the lowest points of the
undulations. Those <i>bosquets</i> were few and far apart,
only to be found where moisture was plentiful. The
remains of a high, flat plateau, which had escaped while
the rest of the country had subsided, loomed alone in
the distance.</p>

<p>One of the central hills was crowned by great
black volcanic boulders of the same rock which
was visible at the southern edge of this great basin,
bounded by vertical cliffs&mdash;all of the same composition.</p>

<p>Directly south-west the evenness of the sky-line
was again interrupted by two mountains&mdash;flat-topped,
one not unlike the gabled roof of a house, the other like
a cylindrical tower on the top of a high conical hill.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-275" id="Pg_1-275"></a>[<a href="images/1-275.png">275</a>]</span>
We again rose to an elevation of 1,950 ft., still travelling
on the summit of the plateau bordering the deep depression.
We were compelled to describe a curve in our
route, and had reached a height of 2,000 ft. We perceived
to the north-east and east a long, uninterrupted&mdash;almost
flat&mdash;sky-line. We had described a sweeping
curve right round the irregular edge of the undulating
plateau. We could now look back upon the southern
aspect of the vertical black and brown rocky cliff, on
the summit of which we had been travelling. The
rocky cliffs were particularly precipitous and picturesque
in the western portion. Interminable campos were
still before us.</p>

<p>I occasionally picked up interesting plants and
flowers for my botanical collection. Innumerable in
this region were the plants with medicinal properties.
The <i>sentori</i> (<i>centaurea</i>) for instance&mdash;plentiful there,
with its sweetly pretty mauve flower&mdash;when boiled in
water gave a bitter decoction good for fever.</p>

<p>We came upon a patch of <i>landir</i> or <i>landirana</i> trees,
with luxuriant dark green foliage. They grew near
the water, and were by far the tallest and handsomest,
cleanest-looking trees I had so far seen in Matto Grosso.
They attained a great height, with extraordinarily dense
foliage, especially at the summit, but also lower down
at the sides. Then <i>burity</i> palms were fairly abundant
wherever one met <i>landir</i> trees in groups or tufts. We
were now travelling at an elevation of 2,050 ft., then
soon after at 2,100 ft. above the sea level. There was
merely stunted vegetation growing upon the red earth
and sand.</p>

<p>On descending from that high point we came upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-276" id="Pg_1-276"></a>[<a href="images/1-276.png">276</a>]</span>
extraordinary scenery. To our right (north) was
another concave depression with a further subsidence
in its central part. Due west and north-west, from the
spot where we first observed the scene, appeared four
curious hemispherical domes forming a quadrangle
with three less important ones beyond. In the south-easterly
portion of the depression was a great rocky
mass, while due north another, and higher, conical
mount, much higher than all the others, could be
observed.</p>

<p>In the eastern part of the depression a wide circle
of big volcanic boulders&mdash;undoubtedly an extinct
crater&mdash;was to be seen, with huge masses of spattered
yellow lava in large blocks as well as ferruginous rock.
That great depression&mdash;taken in its entirety&mdash;was
subdivided into three distinct terraces, counting as
third the summit of the plateau. A mighty, deep,
impressive chasm, smothered in vegetation, could be
observed within the central crater&mdash;in the north-east
side of the circle.</p>

<p>The summit of the plateau, varying in elevation
from 2,000 ft. to 2,100 ft., on which we were travelling
was entirely covered by sand and grey ashes.</p>

<p>The valley in the depression extended in lovely
campos from south-west to north-east&mdash;in fact, as far
as the giant table-land which stood majestic in the
distance.</p>

<p>The scene, as we stood on the edge of the plateau,
was impressive in its grandeur, in its silence. In the
morning the sky was almost entirely covered with
transparent clouds in scales like a fish. In the afternoon
the sky above changed into horizontal layers of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-277" id="Pg_1-277"></a>[<a href="images/1-277.png">277</a>]</span>
globular clouds, which stood as still as death. Leaden
black globular accumulations covered one-third of the
sky vault, great unshapen masses overhead rendering
the air heavy.</p>

<p>We marched all that day on a deep layer of ashes.
On descending from the plateau we had on our left
great clean campos and plentiful <i>burity</i> palms in a
slight depression where moisture filtered through. As
the caravan was moving along gaily, a <i>veado</i> (deer)
gracefully leapt in front and, turning its head back
two or three times to look at us, ran before us. Filippe,
the negro, in his excitement, gave wild yells which set
the mules stampeding, while green parrots in couples,
scared at the sudden disturbance, flew overhead, adding
piercing shrieks to the rapid tinkling of the mules'
bells, the rattling of the baggage on the pack-saddles,
and the shouts of the men trying to stop the excited
mules. All those sudden noises mingled together were
quite a change for us, accustomed to a constant deathly
silence.</p>

<p>Before us on the W.N.W.&mdash;as we still sank in grey
ashes&mdash;were two conical hillocks. In the distance, to
the west, two small flat-topped plateaux rose above the
sky-line, and also two hills shaped not unlike the backs
of two whales. On our left we had an immense crack or
fissure extending from north-east to south-west between
the hill-range on which we travelled and another
on the south&mdash;both showing huge domes of eruptive
rock, apparently extensive flows of red lava subsequently
blackened on the surface by weathering. On the opposite
side to ours the rock was exposed all along the
fissure for a great height, except the surface padding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-278" id="Pg_1-278"></a>[<a href="images/1-278.png">278</a>]</span>
on the summit, where beautiful fresh green grass was
in contrast to the deep tones of the rock. On our
side we were still struggling in ashes and sand, with
striated and much indented boulders of lava showing
through.</p>

<p>We found many <i>sicupira</i> nuts, of a small, flat and
fat oval shape, and a yellow-ochre colour. The shell
contained many tiny cells or chambers&mdash;just like the
section of a beehive. Each chamber was full of a bitter
oil, said to cure almost any complaint known.</p>

<p>On May 22nd I took observations with the hypsometrical
apparatus in order to obtain the correct elevation,
and also as a check to the several aneroids I was
using for differential altitudes. Water boiled at a
temperature of 210&deg; with a temperature of the atmosphere
of 70&deg; Fahr. This would make the elevation
at that spot 1,490 ft. above the sea level. The aneroids
registered 1,480 ft.</p>

<p>We came upon two strange rocks, one resembling
the head and neck of a much-eroded Sphinx&mdash;of natural
formation&mdash;blackened, knobby, and with deep grooves;
the other not unlike a giant mushroom. The sphinx-like
rock stood upon a pedestal also of rock in several
strata. The head was resting on a stratum 1 ft. thick,
of a brilliant red, and at a slight dip. Under it was
a white stratum much cracked, after which came a
stratum of white and red blending into each other.
This stratum, 2 ft. thick, showed the white more
diffused in the upper part than the lower. The lowest
stratum of all exposed was of a deep red.</p>

<p>Near this stood erect another columnar rock of a
similar shape, the head and base entirely of red rock.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-279" id="Pg_1-279"></a>[<a href="images/1-279.png">279</a>]</span>
It was eroded on the north-west side to such an extent
that it was almost concave in the lower part. This
rock, too, showed great cracks and a slight dip north-west
in the strata. Vertical fissures were noticeable,
and seemed caused by concussion.</p>

<p>A third rock&mdash;flat, with a convex bottom&mdash;stood as
if on a pivot on the angular point of a pyramidal larger
rock, this larger rock in its turn resting over a huge
base. There was no mistake as to how those two rocks
had got there. They had fallen from above, one on the
top of the other. A proof of this lay in the fact that
they had arrived with such force that the base had
split at the point of contact. As there was no hill
above or near those rocks, there was little doubt that
they had been flung there by volcanic action.</p>

<p>We were in a region of extraordinary interest and
surprises. In the plain which extended before us there
stood two conical hills in the far north-west, and
three other hills, dome-like, each isolated, but in a most
perfect alignment with the others, towards the east.
Close to us were giant domes of rock, the surface of
which formed marvellous geometrical designs of such
regularity that had they been on a smaller scale one
might have suspected them of being the work of human
beings; but they were not, as we shall see presently.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Salesian Fathers&mdash;A Volcanic Zone</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> arrived at the chief colony of the Salesians, Sagrado
Cora&ccedil;&atilde;o de Jesus (Tachos). There, thanks to the great
kindness and hospitality of the Fathers, and also owing
to the amount of interesting matter I found from a
geological and anthropological point of view, I decided
to halt for a day or two.</p>

<p>The Salesians had come to that spot, not by the way
I had gone, but by an easier way via Buenos Aires and
the Paraguay River, navigable as far as Cuyab&aacute;, the
capital of Matto Grosso. The friars had done wonderful
work in many parts of the State of Matto Grosso.
In fact, what little good in the way of civilization had
been done in that State had been done almost entirely
by those monks. They had established an excellent
college in Cuyab&aacute;, where all kinds of trades and professions
were taught. In the port of Corumb&aacute; a similar
school was established, and then there were the several
colonies among the Indians, such as the Sagrado
Cora&ccedil;&atilde;o de Jesus on the Rio Barreiro, the Immaculada
Concei&ccedil;&atilde;o on the Rio das Gar&ccedil;as, the Sangradouro
Colony, and the Palmeiras.</p>

<p>As in this work I have limited myself to write on
things which have come directly under my observation,
I shall not have an opportunity of speaking of the work<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-281" id="Pg_1-281"></a>[<a href="images/1-281.png">281</a>]</span>
of the Salesians at Cuyab&aacute; or Corumb&aacute;&mdash;two cities I
did not visit&mdash;but I feel it my duty to say a few words
on the work of sacrifice, love and devotion performed
by the friars in those remote regions.</p>

<p>In the colony at Tachos, situated on a height, there
were several neat buildings for the friars and a village
for the Indians. What interested me most was to see
how much of the land around had been converted with
success to agricultural purposes. I inspected the buildings
where useful trades were taught to the Indians of
both sexes. Weaving-looms and spinning-wheels had
been imported at great expense and endless trouble, as
well as blacksmiths' and carpenters' tools of all kinds.
A delightfully neat garden with European flowers was
indeed a great joy to one's eyes, now unaccustomed
to so gay and tidy a sight. What pleased me most of
all was to notice how devoted to the Salesians the
Indians were, and how happy and well cared for they
seemed to be. They had the most humble reverence
for the Fathers.</p>

<p>Padre Antonio Colbacchini, the Father Superior, an
Italian, was an extremely intelligent and practical man,
one of the hardest workers I have ever met. With a
great love for science he had established a small observatory
on a high hill at a considerable distance from
the mission buildings. The abnegation with which
Father Clemente Dorozeski, in charge of the instruments,
would get up in the middle of the night and in all
weathers go and watch for the minimum temperature&mdash;their
instruments were primitive, and they did not
possess self-registering thermometers&mdash;was indeed more
than praiseworthy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-282" id="Pg_1-282"></a>[<a href="images/1-282.png">282</a>]</span>
My readers can easily imagine my surprise when
one day Padre Colbacchini treated me, after dinner,
to an orchestral concert of such operas as <i>Il Trovatore</i>,
<i>A&iuml;da</i>, and the <i>Barbiere di Seviglia</i>, played on brass and
stringed instruments by Indian boys. The Bororos
showed great fondness for music, and readily learned to
play any tune without knowing a single note of music.
Naturally great patience was required on the part of
the teacher in order to obtain a collective melody which
would not seriously impair the drum of one's ear. The
result was truly marvellous. Brass instruments were
preferred by the Indians. The trombone was the most
loved of all. As the Indians all possessed powerful
lungs, they were well suited for wind instruments.</p>

<p>The colony was situated in one of the most
picturesque spots of Matto Grosso. When out for a
walk I came upon a great natural wall of rock with
immense spurs of lava, the surface of which was cut
up into regular geometrical patterns, squares and
lozenges. I think that in that particular case the
peculiarity was due to the lava having flowed over
curved surfaces. In coming in contact with the atmosphere
it had cooled more rapidly on the upper face
than the under, and in contracting quickly had split at
regular intervals, thus forming the geometrical pattern.</p>

<p>It was undoubted that we were there in the former
centre of inconceivable volcanic activity. In other
parts of a great dome of rock I came upon strange holes
in the rock&mdash;extremely common all over that region&mdash;which
might at first glance be mistaken for depressions
formed by glacial action, but which were not.
They were merely moulds of highly ferruginous rock,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-283" id="Pg_1-283"></a>[<a href="images/1-283.png">283</a>]</span>
granular on its surface and not smoothed, as one would
expect in the walls of cavities made by the friction of
revolving ice and rock. Nor did I ever find at the
bottom of any of those pits, worn-down, smooth spherical
or spheroid rocks, such as are usually found in pits of
glacial formation. Those pits had been formed by
lava and molten iron flowing around easily crumbled
blocks of rock, or perhaps by large balls of erupted
mud which had dropped on molten lava, that had
then solidified round them, while the mud or soft rock
had subsequently been dissolved by rain, leaving the
mould intact. The latter theory would seem to me
the more plausible, as many of those pits showed much
indented, raised edges, as if splashing had taken place
when the rock now forming the mould was in semi-liquid
form. Only once or twice did I notice hollows with a
suggestion of spiral grooves in their walls; but I think
that those had been caused at a more recent date by
water flowing in and describing a spiral as it travelled
downward in the interior of the vessels.</p>

<p>On the hill where the observatory was situated two
circular volcanic vents were to be seen. The hill, which
had a slope on one side, had evidently been split, as on
reaching the top I found that an almost vertical precipice
was on the other side. Quantities of quartz and
crystals were to be found on that hill. All over that
region quaintly-shaped rocks were also to be found,
some like small cubic or rectangular boxes, others
not unlike inkstands, others in hollowed cylinders or
spheres. Many&mdash;and those were the quaintest of all&mdash;were
of a rectangular shape, which when split disclosed
a rectangular hollow inside. These natural boxes were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-284" id="Pg_1-284"></a>[<a href="images/1-284.png">284</a>]</span>
mostly of iron rock, laminated, which had evidently
collected when in a liquid state round some soft matter,
that had subsequently evaporated or disappeared with
the intense heat, leaving empty spaces inside. The
laminations were about one-eighth of an inch thick.</p>

<p>Padre Colbacchini told me that some distance off
a curious pool of water existed which he called the
"electric spring." When you placed your hand in it
you received a slight electric shock, while a similar
impression to that of an electric current continued to
be felt as long as you kept your hand in the water.</p>

<p>The mission buildings at Tachos were at an elevation
of 1,600 ft., the observatory, 100 ft. higher.
The temperature on May 23rd was max. 81&deg;, min.
68&middot;4 Fahr. From the observatory hill an uncommon
sight was before us. Seven large and small isolated
conical and domed hills stood in perfect alignment
from N.N.E. to S.S.W. in two different sets.</p>

<p>In that region the prevalent wind was from the
E.S.E. during the months of May, June, July and
August. In September the wind veered gradually to
the north and north-east; whereas during the rainy
season winds from the north, north-west and south-east
were the most prevalent, especially the north-westerly
wind. When the wind came from the north it was
generally accompanied by heavy rain. The rainy
season in that particular zone of the immense Matto
Grosso state extended from October to the end of April.</p>

<p>The Rio Barreiros flowed in a northerly direction
(elev. 1,500 ft.) over a bed of red lava, ashes, red earth,
and sand. After leaving this river we quickly rose
again to an altitude of 1,700 ft. upon a first hill, then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-285" id="Pg_1-285"></a>[<a href="images/1-285.png">285</a>]</span>
to 1,800 ft. on a second, and 1,850 ft. on a third elevation
over a great spur of red lava, extending in a graceful
curve well into the valley below.</p>

<p>Exquisite was the view of the great plain below us,
with its magnificent campos stretching as far as the
eye could see, far away to the horizon line. In the far
distance, scattered here and there, rose the peculiar
flat-topped isolated mountains before described. Again
all that day we marched over ashes, red sand, and
volcanic d&eacute;bris. The highest point we reached was
1,950 ft. A snake dashed across our way among the
hoofs of my mule, but no harm was done.</p>

<p>Near Camp Bugueir&atilde;o (elev. 1,800 ft.), where we
halted, there was a delightful, clear, tiny spring emerging
from white volcanic crystallized rock. Then more
campos over lovely undulations in the country. Close
by was what the Brazilians call a <i>furnas</i> (from the
Latin <i>fornus</i>)&mdash;a somewhat misapplied term by which
they named any deep hollow or chasm, whether vertical
like a precipice or horizontal such as a cave.</p>

<p>It was getting slightly less cold during the nights.
On May 24th the Fahrenheit thermometer registered a
minimum of 60&deg; and a maximum temperature of 75&deg;.</p>

<p>Owing to the usual trouble of recovering the mules
in the morning we only left camp at 10.30 a.m., rising
over great masses of ferruginous rock, which showed
through the deposits of ashes and sand at an elevation
of 1,950 ft. The immense view of the campos in great
undulations was really exquisite to the west and south-west.</p>

<p>My mules were then travelling over a strange narrow
strip of rock at a height of 2,050 ft.&mdash;in some places<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-286" id="Pg_1-286"></a>[<a href="images/1-286.png">286</a>]</span>
only a few yards across&mdash;on the top of vertical walls
dividing two deep valleys, one to the south, very extensive,
with great lava-flows; another to the north.
In the latter valley an immense extinct crater was
visible, in three well-defined internal terraces and a
deep central depression.</p>

<p>Upon climbing on the summit of a high conical hill
I further discovered that the crater had an elongated
shape, the longest diameter being from north to south,
the southern and lower part being overlapped by a
voluminous flow of lava which also covered a great part
of the mountain slope. Strange monoliths were numerous,
among the many fantastically shaped rocks, and
also boulders lying about at all angles. One like a
huge table rested on the top of another, upon which
it had fallen with great force, as could be seen by
the vertical splitting of the rock underneath. The rock
above appeared simply broiled&mdash;and so were the huge
masses of d&eacute;bris, especially of ferruginous rock, which
had evidently been ejected by that crater. The entire
summit of the crater cone (2,100 ft. above the sea
level) was of hard black baked rock.</p>

<p>Close by, to the north, was another peculiar oval
depression, the highest part of which to the north-west
was in four distinct terraces in the interior. The
eastern part was more flattened, not unlike a huge soup
plate. In the centre was another deep depression&mdash;possibly
an extinct crater too. This second crater was
to the north of the high-domed crater described above.</p>

<p>In the near west we had mere undulations over
which we gradually travelled, but the country was
getting much more disturbed than it had appeared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-287" id="Pg_1-287"></a>[<a href="images/1-287.png">287</a>]</span>
since leaving the Araguaya River. Due west farther
away stood before us a weird-looking plateau with a
vertical high wall to the north. To the south it showed
three terraces, the two lower ones supported on perpendicular
cliffs, whereas a convex slope was between
the second and third, or top terrace. To the south-west
in the far distance another high plateau could be perceived,
also with vertical cliffs to the north, but slanting
at its southern end&mdash;a shape characteristic of nearly all
the isolated mountains of that zone.</p>

<p>Looking south we perceived great tongues of lava
extending from east to west&mdash;the eastern point being
higher than the western, showing that the lava had
flowed there from east to west. Then there was also
a great sloping grassy slant, possibly over another extensive
lava-flow, from the crater we had examined.
Extending toward the south-west was another tongue
of lava of great width when measured from north-west
to south-east, the latter (south-east) being its
lowest point. On its north-east side this great flow
had a high vertical face. Between these enormous
tongues of lava, east to west and south-east to north-west,
was a depression or channel extending as far as
a distant high dome in three terraces to the south-west.
On our course we came upon more curious flattened
eruptive rocks, which had split on falling with great
force to earth after having been ejected from a volcano.</p>

<p>Other parallel ranges could be clearly perceived.
To bearings magnetic 160&deg; were again to be seen our old
friends the two strange gabled-roof and tower mountains.</p>

<p>I climbed up on the Pared&atilde;ozinho volcano (2,100 ft.
above the sea level) to examine its extinct crater,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-288" id="Pg_1-288"></a>[<a href="images/1-288.png">288</a>]</span>
subdivided into two distinct large craters and a subsidiary
one.</p>

<p>One of these craters extended from east to west,
and had in one section on its rim a giant dome split
into quadrangular and lozenge-shaped sections, not
unlike magnified mosaic work. Next to it was a great
hill with a vertical natural wall overlooking the crater
itself. The horizontal strata of this natural wall, each
about a foot thick, looked exactly like a wonderful
masonry work, so perfectly straight were the strata,
and the square and rectangular rocks laid in lines with
such extraordinary regularity. This wall stood upon
solid masses of rock of immense size&mdash;hundreds of feet
in height.</p>

<p>The lip of the crater on the south side was just like
the well-laid pavement of a city, so regularly had the
lava cracked in contracting, thus leaving four- and
five-sided geometrical figures, all well fitting in with
their neighbours. Again, in this case, the lava, flowing
over a convex surface, had contracted on the surface
and caused the wonderful network of grooves. In
one section the crater had the appearance of an ancient
Roman or Etruscan amphitheatre with seats in many
tiers or steps, separated by vertical cracks&mdash;as if cut
out into separate blocks of stone.</p>

<p class="fsc">Volcanic Cavities (Matto Grosso).</p>
<hr />
<p>On the east side of the greatest portion of one
crater&mdash;which would seem to have been the most active
of all&mdash;I found again immense boulders with stratified
rock above them resembling masonry work, just the
same as and at the same elevation as the layers I had
examined in the larger elongated horseshoe crater. In
the centre of the smaller crater there flowed a rivulet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-289" id="Pg_1-289"></a>[<a href="images/1-289.png">289</a>]</span>
of crystal-like water most delicious to drink. Undoubtedly
those eastern rocks were the lip of the crater,
for I discovered there two flows of lava in corrugations
and network designs such as we had observed on the
summit of the greater section. I had great difficulty
in climbing up the steep internal walls of the crater,
and on the steep slopes with dried grass, which was
slippery to a degree. On the top of the crater were
great masses of carbonated rock; also patches of
lapilli, and red and white sand, plentiful everywhere
in that zone.</p>

<p>The smaller crater&mdash;it seemed to me&mdash;must have
been a mere safety valve for the larger one. Its elevation,
it will be noticed, was the same as that of the latter.
From the summit of the one on which I was standing I
could perceive the other to the E.N.E., forming the
eastern boundary of this immense volcanic hollow.
The southern part of this great double crater was subdivided
into several sections, all in great rocky terraces&mdash;quite
vertical except in their lower portion, which
was sloping and had evidently been filled to a great
extent by an accumulation of ashes and erupted refuse.
On the side on which I stood, however, the crater had
not the diabolical, quite awe-inspiring, appearance of
the larger section of the huge volcanic mouth&mdash;quite
unscaleable by humans in its central section. In the
deep cracks in the rock were several small grottoes. I
experienced some difficulty and much fatigue in climbing
to the top (elev. 1,750 ft.) of the extinct volcano,
and especially in reaching the lip of the crater, owing
to the thick and much entangled scrub with innumerable
thorns.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-290" id="Pg_1-290"></a>[<a href="images/1-290.png">290</a>]</span>
Our camp was at 1,500 ft., in a delightful spot at the
junction of two streams, one from the south descending
from the volcano, the other from the north. The two
rivers united flowed north&mdash;I think eventually into the
Rio das Mortes.</p>

<p>When we moved out of camp on May 25th (temperature,
minimum 62&deg;, maximum 80&deg; Fahr.) I noticed that,
after passing the wall-like section of the crater in the
northern aspect, there were strata with a dip south in
the inner part of the crater. The northern face of this
vertical wall showed thick strata cracked into squares
and rectangles with a dip in two different directions
at an angle. There a draining channel had formed.
Two rows of circular holes&mdash;like port-holes&mdash;were to
be seen, one directly under the summit, the other
one-third down the cliff side. A giant rectangular
tower of solid rock stood erect parallel to the great
wall. Skirting this vertical wall we travelled north-west-by-west,
rising gradually to 1,800 ft. on a deep
layer of red volcanic sand and grey ashes.</p>

<p>Looking back to the east we had a complete view of
the two-tiered plateaux with their vertical northern
walls, showing a dip south in their stratification. A
crowning mound could also be observed surpassing their
height, when we rose still higher to 1,900 ft. on the
summit of a ledge of cracked lava with a slant west-wards.
On the eastern side, where it had crumbled
owing to a subsidence, it showed a rounded moulding,
whereas on the other side were great waves of lava.
The lava had flowed from east to west.</p>

<p>After leaving this curious spot we went over undulating
red and ochre-coloured sand and more grey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-291" id="Pg_1-291"></a>[<a href="images/1-291.png">291</a>]</span>
ashes. We rose twice to an elevation of 2,000 ft. We
crossed a streamlet of delicious water flowing north
over a red lava bed. Then more and more ashes
were found all along. A second stream&mdash;also flowing
north&mdash;was then negotiated, also over a red lava bed
(elev. 1,800 ft.), after which we climbed to 2,000 ft.,
descending soon after to 1,900 ft. on the banks of
another river flowing north-east.</p>

<p>At this spot were two more enormous lava-flows&mdash;one
on each side of the stream, and extending in a
tortuous course from south-west to north-east. The
lava had flowed north-east.</p>

<p>On rising slowly in deep red sand to an elevation
of 2,100 ft. we saw two prominent elevations of brilliant
red colouring to the south&mdash;they, too, with vertical
cliffs to the north. To the west loomed two huge
twin plateaux separated by an immense crack, also
with vertical walls to the north and a slight dip south
in the strata forming the various terraces.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> had reached a spot of most amazing scenery&mdash;the
Pared&atilde;o Grande&mdash;a giant hill mass displaying a great
crater in its north side. Two high cones stood
above the immense red-baked wall at its eastern end,
where it was in huge blocks stratified in thicknesses
varying from 15 to 20 ft. each. In that eastern section
the strata were perfectly horizontal. On the western
side of the crater was a colossal quadrangular mountain
of red-baked rock&mdash;a solid mass of granite with a
narrow band, slightly discoloured, all along its summit.
There&mdash;above&mdash;we also perceived a slight grassy slope,
and above it again a great natural wall in layers 6 ft.
thick. From the bottom of the mountain this upper
natural wall resembled the defences of a great castle
built on the summit of the giant rock. In approaching
this strange sight we had gone over extensive deposits
of ashes and yellow lava pellets and balls.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill1-292.jpg"><img src="images/ill1-292_th.jpg" alt="A Vertical Mass of Solid Rock of a Brilliant Red Colour." title="A Vertical Mass of Solid Rock of a Brilliant Red Colour." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">A Vertical Mass of Solid Rock of a Brilliant Red Colour.</p>
<hr />
<p>The elevation at the foot of this immense block
was 1,970 ft., the summit of the rock 660 ft. higher&mdash;so
that the reader can easily imagine how impressive
this quadrangular block of bright red rock was, several
hundred yards in length on each side and 201 metres
high.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-293" id="Pg_1-293"></a>[<a href="images/1-293.png">293</a>]</span>
As we reached camp rather early I went to examine
the block from all sides. On the southern side Alcides
and I climbed up to within 30 ft. of the summit, and
from that high point obtained a stupendous panoramic
view of the great expanse of undulating country to the
south and south-east, while it was almost absolutely
flat to the west as far as the horizon line.</p>

<p>To the south-west were distinguishable some extraordinary-looking
cylindrical table-lands&mdash;like immense
sections of columns&mdash;rising well above the horizon line.
To the south in the distance a peculiar formation of
mountains could be seen&mdash;first a separate prismatic
mountain like a gabled roof with a well-defined vertical
high wall standing all along its longitudinal apex line.
Parallel to this and to one another were three sets of
mountains, with such steep sides that they seemed
like gigantic walls standing up on the flat country.
Behind them was a flat-topped plateau with a small
cone rising above it. The sides of the latter plateau
formed a steep escarpment. To the south-east was
a domed plateau, red in its lower section, green on the
top. Between this plateau and the last wall-like mountain,
several hundred feet in height, stood a conical
peak with a natural tower of rock upon it.</p>

<p>Beyond, to the south-east, could just be perceived two
pyramidal mountains, but they were very distant and
scarcely visible. The valley itself was greatly furrowed
in deep, long channels. Due south were dome-like
mounds&mdash;each of these, mind you, standing out individually
upon an almost flat plain.</p>

<p>In the north-western corners of the great quadrangular
Pared&atilde;o rock I saw a spot where it would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-294" id="Pg_1-294"></a>[<a href="images/1-294.png">294</a>]</span>
have been quite easy to climb up to the summit, as
portions of the rock had crumbled down and had left
an incline. But I had no object in making the ascent
on that side, especially as I had already obtained the
view I required from the south side. Also because I
was heavily laden, carrying cameras, aneroids, a large
prismatic compass, and three heavy bags of money
slung to the belt round my waist, and did not feel up
to the extra and useless exertion. Great arches with
a span of over 80 metres were to be seen in the lower
part of the western wall. To the south there was a
huge spur of lava with the geometrical pattern upon
its surface we had already observed elsewhere. In this
particular case, too, it appeared to me that the peculiar
net of surface channels had been formed in coming
in contact with the air, and not underground in the
boiling cauldron of the volcano when the ebullition of
the rock ceased. They were only found at a lower
elevation because they had gone down with a great
subsidence which had taken place, and in which
neither the quadrangular Pared&atilde;o Grande, nor the
peculiar isolated mountains we had observed from its
height, had been affected. They had remained standing
when all the rest sank for some six hundred feet and,
in places, more. That might perhaps account for the
extraordinary shapes of all those mountains, which
could not otherwise be explained.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill1-294.jpg"><img src="images/ill1-294_th.jpg" alt="The Pared&atilde;o Grande (Matto-Grosso)." title="The Pared&atilde;o Grande (Matto-Grosso)." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">The Pared&atilde;o Grande (Matto-Grosso).</p>
<hr />
<p>At the foot of the vertical giant block on the west
many domes of lava, channelled in a quadrangular network
pattern, and ridges and cones, were found, all
with a slope to the west. I had a great struggle in my
research work that day, owing to the thick scrub with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-295" id="Pg_1-295"></a>[<a href="images/1-295.png">295</a>]</span>
vicious thorns that tore one's clothes and skin mercilessly.</p>

<p>We came upon an immense deep crack in the earth
surface&mdash;a regular ca&ntilde;on&mdash;which extended all along
the centre of the great valley. On the opposite side
of it were again big domes of lava in corrugated designs,
also a gigantic circular crater. Many natural crucibles
of iron rock, some cylindrical in shape, others oval,
others formed not unlike Pompeian lamps&mdash;while others
still were square or rectangular or lozenge-shaped&mdash;were
to be seen in many spots on the moraine-like
tails that extended southward, like the tentacles of an
octopus, and in the heaps of much carbonized rock and
solidified froth produced by what was once boiling rock.
The mounds of froth were usually collected in depressions.</p>

<p>The west side of the Pared&atilde;o was decidedly the
most interesting of all. Its great arches showed that
it must have once formed the sides of a great cauldron&mdash;the
top of which had subsequently collapsed or been
blown off. This seemed quite apparent from the discoloration
in the rocky cliff some 50 ft. above the
arches, which followed the exact line of what must
have been the thickness of the vault. The rock in
that discoloured section was perfectly smooth, whereas
above that it became much cracked vertically in layers,
and gave the appearance of a masonry wall.</p>

<p>Toward the south-western corner there was a
prismatic tower. Where the peculiar isolated rocks
near the tower formed a spur, a dip was noticeable in
the flow of the once molten rock, following what must
have been at that time the surface soil over the cauldron's
roof.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-296" id="Pg_1-296"></a>[<a href="images/1-296.png">296</a>]</span>
A huge triangular crater could be seen, from which
started an enormous crack of great length in the lava-flow
of the valley to the west.</p>

<p>The southern face of that stupendous rocky quadrangle
was not quite so vertical as the west and north
sides, and was more in tiers or steps of lava&mdash;but very
steep indeed. It had in its lower part a great spur
extending southward.</p>

<p>As I have said, Alcides and I arrived within 30 ft.
of the summit of the great Pared&atilde;o, at an elevation of
2,550 ft., the summit being 2,580 ft.; but owing to the
last 30 ft. being absolutely vertical and the top rock
of a crumbling nature, and as my object in wishing to
obtain a full view of the country to the south had
been attained, I did not think it worth while to court
an accident for nothing. It was well after sunset when
we were up there, and it would take a long time to
return to camp. So we hastened on our return journey.</p>

<p>The sunset that night&mdash;which we watched from
that high point of vantage&mdash;was really too stupendous
for words, and not unlike an aurora borealis&mdash;red, gold
and violet lines radiating from the sun like a gorgeous
fan and expanding as they approached the summit of
the sky vault. The descent was more difficult than the
ascent, owing to the slippery nature of the rock.</p>

<p>At night, while back in camp, we saw to the W.N.W.,
quite low on the horizon, a brilliant planet&mdash;possibly
Venus. The stars and planets appeared always wonderfully
bright and extraordinarily large on fine nights.
Whether it was an optical illusion or not I do not
know, but the phenomenon, which lasted some hours,
was seen by all my men, and appeared also when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-297" id="Pg_1-297"></a>[<a href="images/1-297.png">297</a>]</span>
planet was seen through a powerful hand telescope.
It seemed to discharge powerful intermittent flashes,
red and greenish, only toward the earth. Those flashes
were similar to and more luminous than the tail of a
small comet, and of course much shorter&mdash;perhaps
four to five times the diameter of the planet in their
entire length.</p>

<p>Whether this phenomenon was due to an actual
astral disturbance, or to light-signalling to the earth
or other planet, it would be difficult&mdash;in fact, impossible&mdash;to
ascertain with the means I had at my command.
Perhaps it was only an optical illusion caused by
refraction and deflected rays of vision, owing to the
effect upon the atmosphere of the heated rocky mass
by our side and under us&mdash;such as is the case in effects
of mirage. I am not prepared to express an opinion,
and only state what my men and I saw, merely suggesting
what seem to me the most plausible explanations.</p>

<p>At moments the planet seemed perfectly spherical,
with a marvellously definite outline, and then the
flashes were shot out especially to the right as one
looked at the planet, and downward slightly at an
angle, not quite perpendicularly.</p>

<p>That night, May 25th-26th, was cold: min. 58&deg;
Fahr. But during the day at 9 a.m. the thermometer
already registered 85&deg; Fahr.</p>

<p>The sky, half covered by flimsy transparent mist to
the east, and by globular thin clouds, large overhead and
of smaller dimensions to the west, developed later in the
day into a charming mackerel sky, with two great
arches of mist to the south, and delicate horizontal
layers of mist near the earth.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-298" id="Pg_1-298"></a>[<a href="images/1-298.png">298</a>]</span>
It was only when we were some distance off that
we obtained a full and glorious view of the western side
of the Pared&atilde;o. The upper stratum showed a slight
dip north, then there was a ledge on which grass seemed
to flourish, and below it two parallel strata in a wavy
line from north to south. Those two strata could be
traced again&mdash;after a dip&mdash;in the range with two cones,
separated as we have seen by a deep gap from the
great wall-cliffs of the Pared&atilde;o. The indication of what
must have been once an enormous dome over a huge
cavity or cauldron could be noticed in the western cliff,
and also numerous chambers, large and small&mdash;at
least, judging by the arches in great numbers noticeable
in the wall. In other words, you had there the same
effect as the one often seen in cities when houses are
pulled down and the remains of the various rooms are
visible on the remaining side walls.</p>

<p>Looking north as we left the disturbed region of the
Pared&atilde;o Grande, we came upon a great valley, with a
depression in its centre. We were still travelling on
volcanic ochre-coloured sand in deep layers, especially
as we rose to an altitude of 2,350 ft., overlooking a huge
basin. We had then a good general view of the southern
aspect of the Pared&atilde;o Grande. In its side a huge gap
with vertical walls&mdash;a vent perhaps&mdash;could be noticed,
reaching as far as the summit of the mountain. It was
interesting to note that all the great cracks in the
earth's crust found in that region almost invariably
had a direction from north to south, so that the ranges
which remained bordering them must have split in a
lateral movement east and west.</p>

<p>Six kilometres from camp through the forest we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-299" id="Pg_1-299"></a>[<a href="images/1-299.png">299</a>]</span>
came upon some singularly delicious green, smooth
grassy slopes. In other places were perfectly circular
or oval concave basins of volcanic ashes, in the centre
of which stood charming groups of <i>burity</i> palms and
trees with most luxuriant foliage. These <i>bosquets</i> existed
in the hollow of all the basins where profuse
infiltrations of moisture caused the luxuriant vegetation.</p>

<p>We were at an elevation of 2,350 ft. On going
down to a stream (elev. 2,130 ft.) we encountered great
flows of lava. It had flowed in a westerly direction.
We were proceeding through enchanting vegetation
when we came to a second and a third <i>cuvette</i> or basin
adorned with plentiful healthy palms in its central
point.</p>

<p>As I was admiring the curious sight of these clusters
of high vegetation absolutely surrounded by a wide
band of lawn&mdash;such as one would see in a well-kept
English park&mdash;a heavy and sudden storm arrived, which
in a few seconds drenched us to the marrow of our
bones. I have seldom seen or felt drops of water of
such weight and size as when the rain began, followed
within a few seconds by a downpour in bucketfuls.</p>

<p>Animals, baggage, and men, dripping all over, went
along, rising to 2,400 ft. above the sea level, by the side
of a conical hill. A huge block of volcanic rock&mdash;shot
and deposited there evidently from elsewhere&mdash;was to
be seen near by.</p>

<p>Eighteen kilometres from our last camp we descended
to a streamlet, dividing a grassy basin like the
preceding ones. Again I noticed here that all divisions
between ranges&mdash;caused by volcanic or other violent
action, and not by erosion&mdash;were in a direction from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-300" id="Pg_1-300"></a>[<a href="images/1-300.png">300</a>]</span>
north to south. We had this in the Pared&atilde;o Grande,
and in the triple division of the top-dyked mountains on
the south, and also in the gabled and tower mountains
we had observed for some days to the south-west.</p>

<p>Again during the night I saw to the west the phenomenon
of the previous evening repeated&mdash;the strange
flashes directly under and occasionally to the left of
the brilliant planet&mdash;that is to say to the right of the
person observing it.</p>

<p>This was from Camp Areal, where we suffered terribly
during the day from our friends the <i>pium</i>, which filled
our eyes and ears and stung us all over; and at sunset
from the <i>polvora</i> or <i>polvorinha</i> (or powder), so called
because of their infinitesimal size&mdash;most persistent
mosquitoes, so greedy that they preferred to be squashed
rather than escape when they were sucking our blood
on our hands and faces. Fortunately, during the
night&mdash;with the cold (min. Fahr. 56&deg;)&mdash;we had a little
respite, and these brutes disappeared, only to return
to their attack at sunrise with the warmth of the sun.
At 9 a.m. the thermometer already registered a temperature
of 95&deg; Fahr. in the sun&mdash;a jump of 39&deg;, which,
notwithstanding mosquitoes and <i>pium</i>, my men greatly
enjoyed.</p>

<p class="fsc">The Pared&atilde;o Grande, showing Vertical Rocks with Great Arches.</p>
<hr />
<p>I have never seen men suffer more from the cold
than my followers. They were simply paralyzed and
frozen at that comparatively high temperature. They
moaned and groaned and wept all night, although they
slept in their clothes and were tightly wrapped up in
heavy blankets. Moreover, they had spread a heavy
waterproof double tent over the lot of them, as they
lay closely packed to one another, covering heads and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-301" id="Pg_1-301"></a>[<a href="images/1-301.png">301</a>]</span>
all, and had arranged a blazing fire enough to roast an
ox quite close to them.</p>

<p>Personally, I was quite happy under a mere shelter
tent&mdash;open for precaution on all sides, owing to preceding
experiences, so that I could see what was going
on all around without getting up from my camp bed.
I only had a mere thin camel-hair blanket over me. I
never slept in my clothes, preferring the comfort of
ample silk pyjamas. In the morning I always indulged
in my cold shower bath, two large buckets of water
being poured by Alcides upon my head and back,
amid the shivering yells of my trembling companions,
who, at a distance, watched the operation, wrapped
up to such an extent that merely their eyes were
exposed.</p>

<p>"He is mad!" I often heard them murmur with
chattering teeth.</p>

<p>Beneath heavy horizontal clouds low in the sky and
ball-like cloudlets above, we started off once more
from an elevation of 2,100 ft. at the camp to proceed
over a plateau 2,300 ft. high and some 6 kil. broad from
east to west. Then we descended into another charming
<i>cuvette</i> (elev. 2,100 ft.), and farther on to a streamlet
flowing north, the Rio Coriseo.</p>

<p>We were then travelling over reddish and ochre-coloured
volcanic sand, going through stunted and
fairly open <i>matto</i> (forest), higher up at 2,250 ft. in
successive undulations crossing our route at right
angles. In one of the depressions (elev. 2,150 ft.) was
a river&mdash;the Rio Torresino&mdash;flowing north. Quantities
of yellow globular lava pellets and lumpy blocks&mdash;evidently
ejected by a volcano&mdash;were seen.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-302" id="Pg_1-302"></a>[<a href="images/1-302.png">302</a>]</span>
The stream Cabe&ccedil;a de Boi&mdash;forming after the Rio
Macacos (or River of Monkeys) a tributary of the Rio
das Mortes, into which flowed all the rivulets we had
lately met&mdash;was next crossed (elev. 2,130 ft.). Over
more and deep beds of ashes we journeyed at 2,270 ft.
on the southern edge of a great grassy basin extending
from east to west. Again a delightful group of palms
and healthy trees was in the typical depression. Ant-hills
were innumerable on all sides. One could not
help admiring their architectural lines, which formed all
kinds of miniature fortresses and castles. We were
worried to death by the <i>pium</i> or <i>lambe-olhos</i> (eye-lickers),
as the Brazilians call them, which followed us
all day in swarms around our heads and hands, entering
our mouths, noses, eyes and ears. Only for a few
moments, when there blew a gust of wind, were we freed
from this pest, but they soon returned to their attack
with renewed vigour.</p>

<p>We rose again to an altitude of 2,380 ft. on another
great dome of red lava, which had flowed northwards,
as could be plainly seen as we ascended on its rounded
back. Upon it were quantities of crystals and yellow
lava pellets and pebbles and carbonated rock, resting
on whitish and grey ashes. On the summit, where
fully exposed, numerous perforations, cracks and striations
were visible in the flow, we were able to observe
plainly how the lava in a liquid state had flowed and
quickly cooled while other strata of liquid lava flowed
over it, one overlapping another like the scales of a
fish, and forming so many oval or ovoid bosses with
channels between.</p>

<p>From that high point we had a perfectly level sky-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-303" id="Pg_1-303"></a>[<a href="images/1-303.png">303</a>]</span>line
all around us, except for the Pared&atilde;o Grande and
the Pared&atilde;ozinho, then to the E.N.E. of us.</p>

<p>At an elevation of 2,520 ft. we perceived that day
to the E.S.E. a double-towered massive rocky mountain
of a brilliant red colour, reminding one of the shape of
an Egyptian temple, and a lower hill range in undulations
behind it to the south, projecting at its sides.</p>

<p>We were marching on the northern edge of deep
and extensive depressions to the south and south-east
of us. Domed undulations in progressive steps from
north to south were noticeable in the southern portion
of the landscape, and from south to north in the northern
and much-wooded zone.</p>

<p>When we were at an elevation of 2,550 ft. we had
still red and yellow sand and ashes with stunted and
sparse vegetation. Upon descending we skirted the
southern side of another peculiar oval basin&mdash;this
time one which possessed a thin strip or row of tall
vegetation in perfect alignment in the central line of
depression. A deep deposit of grey ashes and sand
encircled this <i>cuvette</i>. The general longitudinal direction
of the oval was from the south, the highest point,
to the north, the lowest of the rim.</p>

<p>Having travelled 28 kil. from Areal we made camp
on a streamlet flowing north.</p>

<p>The company of my men was a great trial to me&mdash;a
penance I had to bear in silence. What was more, I
could not let it appear in the slightest degree that it
was a penance to me, if I did not wish to make matters
worse. Pusillanimity and fear are two qualities which
I cannot quite understand nor admit in men. Hence,
it is well to be imagined what I suffered in being with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-304" id="Pg_1-304"></a>[<a href="images/1-304.png">304</a>]</span>
followers who, with the exception of Alcides and Filippe
the negro, were afraid of everything.</p>

<p>One of the men had a toothache. His last tooth
in the lower jaw was so badly decayed that merely
the outside shell remained. No doubt it gave him
great pain. I offered to remove it for him&mdash;without
a guarantee of painless extraction. The fear of greater
pain than he endured&mdash;even for a few minutes&mdash;was
too much for him. He would not hear of parting with
what remained of the tooth. Result: for twelve consecutive
days and nights that fellow cried and moaned
incessantly&mdash;holding his jaw with both hands while
riding a quiet mule, and sobbing <i>hai, hai, hai, hai!</i> all
day long at each step of the animal&mdash;with variations
of <i>hoi, hoi, hoi, hoi</i>, when the mule went a little quicker,
and significant loud shrieks of <i>uppepp&eacute;, uppepp&eacute;,
uppepp&eacute;</i> when the animal began to trot, giving the rider
an extra pang. That intense pain invariably stopped
at meal-times, and it did not seem to have an appreciable
effect on the man's ravenous appetite. My men
never let a chance go by to let their companions share
to the fullest extent in their sufferings. They had no
consideration whatever for other people's feelings. In
all the months they were with me they never once
showed the slightest trace of thoughtfulness towards
me, or indeed even towards any of their comrades.</p>

<p>Mean to an incredible degree in their nature&mdash;and
I am certain no one could have been more generous
than I was to them in every possible way&mdash;they believed
that no matter what I did was due to wishing to save
money. If I would not allow them to blaze away dozens
of cartridges at a rock or a lizard&mdash;cartridges were a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-305" id="Pg_1-305"></a>[<a href="images/1-305.png">305</a>]</span>
most expensive luxury in Central Brazil, and, what was
more, could not be replaced&mdash;it was because I wished to
economize. If one day I ate a smaller tin of sardines
because I was not so hungry, remarks flew freely about
that I was a miser; if I did not pitch a tent because I
preferred, for many reasons, sleeping out in the open
on fine nights, it was, according to them, because I
wished to spare the tent to sell it again at a higher
price when I returned home! They discussed these
things in a high voice and in a most offensive way,
making my hands itch on many occasions and my
blood boil. But I had made up my mind that I would
never lose my temper with them, nor my calm; and
I never did, trying as it was to keep my promise.</p>

<p>With all this meanness of which they were accusing
me, these poltroons were clothed in garments such as
they had never before possessed in their lives; they
were gorging themselves with food such as they had
never dreamt of having in their homes, where they had
lived like pariah dogs&mdash;and huge heaps were thrown
daily to the dogs&mdash;and they were paid a salary five
times higher than they could have possibly earned
under Brazilian employers.</p>

<p>What annoyed me a great deal with these men was
the really criminal way in which they&mdash;notwithstanding
my instructions&mdash;always tried to smash my
cameras and scientific instruments and to injure anything
I possessed. Those men were vandals by nature.
The more valuable an object was, the greater the
pleasure they seemed to take in damaging it.</p>

<p>Thus another and unnecessary burden was placed
upon me in order to save my instruments from destruc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-306" id="Pg_1-306"></a>[<a href="images/1-306.png">306</a>]</span>tion,
not only from natural accidents but through the
infamy of my followers. Those fellows seemed to take
no pride in anything. Even the beautiful and expensive
repeating rifles and automatic pistols I had given
each man had been reduced to scrap-iron. Yet they
were so scared of Indians that the first time we met
some, they handed over to them anything that took
their fancy&mdash;and which belonged to me, of course&mdash;for
fear of incurring their ill-favour. During my absence
from camp they even gave away to the Indians a
handsome dog I had, which I never was able to trace
again.</p>

<p>Like all people with a dastardly nature, they could
on no account speak the truth&mdash;even when it would
have been to their advantage. They could never
look you straight in the face. Hence, full of distrust
for everybody, all the responsibility of every kind
of work in connection with the expedition fell upon
me. I not only had to do my own scientific work,
but had to supervise in its minutest detail all the work
done by them, and all the time. It was indeed like
travelling with a band of mischievous demented people.
The mental strain was considerable for me.</p>

<p>On that day's march we had passed two crosses
erected, the Salesians had told me, on the spot where
two men had been murdered by passing Brazilians&mdash;not
by Indians. Their usual way of procedure was
to shoot people in the back&mdash;never in front&mdash;or else
when you were asleep. Nearly all carried a razor on
their person&mdash;not to shave with, but in order to cut
people's throats as a vengeance, or even under less
provocation. This was usually done in a quick way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-307" id="Pg_1-307"></a>[<a href="images/1-307.png">307</a>]</span>
by severing the artery at the neck while the person
to be killed was asleep.</p>

<p>The Brazilians of the interior were almost altogether
the descendants of criminal Portuguese, who had been
exiled to the country, and intermarried with the lowest
possible class of African slaves. They seemed to feel
strongly their inferiority when facing a European,
and imagined&mdash;in which they were not far wrong&mdash;the
contempt with which, although it was covered by
the greatest politeness, one looked down upon them.
That was perhaps the only excuse one could offer for
their vile behaviour, which, according to their low
mental qualities, they liked to display in order to prove
their independence and superiority.</p>

<p>We made our camp in a heavenly spot&mdash;barring the
devilish <i>borrachudo</i> (mosquitoes)&mdash;on the bank of a
crystal-like streamlet flowing north (elev. 2,200 ft.).
We were really fortunate to have excellent and plentiful
water all the time. The thermometer went down during
the night to a minimum of 54&deg; Fahr. There were more
shivers and moans from my men. Only Alcides and
Filippe behaved in a manly way. The others were in
terror of attacks from the <i>on&ccedil;a pintada</i> (<i>felis on&ccedil;a</i>) or
spotted jaguar of Brazil, and of the <i>terrivel tamanduas
bandeira</i>, a toothless pachyderm, with a long and hairy
tail, long nails, and powerful arms, the embrace of
which is said to be sufficient to kill a man, or even
a jaguar, so foolish as to endeavour wrestling with
it. It had a long protruding nose or proboscis, which
it inserted into ant-heaps. A tongue of abnormal
length was further pushed out, and then quickly withdrawn
when crammed with attacking ants. Ants were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-308" id="Pg_1-308"></a>[<a href="images/1-308.png">308</a>]</span>
its favourite food. Although my men talked all the
time of the terrible <i>bandeiras</i>, we never had the good
fortune to receive the fond embraces of one.</p>

<p>We had a beautiful sky&mdash;perfectly clear&mdash;on May
28th, except perhaps a faint curtain of mist near
the horizon to the west. Two of my horses had unfortunately
strayed; and as the men searched the <i>matto</i>
with trembling knees in fear of meeting a <i>bandeira</i>
instead of the missing horses, they were not recovered
until late in the afternoon, so that we did not depart
until 4 p.m.</p>

<p>We went up to the top of an undulation (elev.
2,400 ft.), on grey ashes as usual in the lower part of
the hill, and red volcanic sand on the summit. That
afternoon's journey was not unlike tobogganing up and
down all the time&mdash;at elevations varying from 2,500
to 2,350 ft.&mdash;over domes of sand, ashes, and eruptive
rock, and dykes with depressions, some 100 ft. deep
or so, and all extending from north to south.</p>

<p>We saw some gorgeous red <i>araras</i> or macaws of
giant size. They were a beautiful sight as they flew,
with their hoarse shrieks, above our heads.</p>

<p>At sunset we were travelling along the north edge
of a great grassy depression wooded in its central pit&mdash;the
line of depression and of the central vegetation
being from north to south.</p>

<p class="fsc">A Great Earthquake Fissure in the Terrestrial Crust (Matto Grosso).</p>
<hr />
<p>We were treated to a glorious sunset. The entire
sky had become of a deep violet colour and Indian red,
relieved here and there by golden tints, with blue
cloudlets of wonderful regularity in a line. Curiously
enough, the most brilliant colouring was to the east
and not to the west, as would have been expected.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-309" id="Pg_1-309"></a>[<a href="images/1-309.png">309</a>]</span>
Eventually the entire sky became of a glorious yellow,
like a golden cupola&mdash;blending into a lovely emerald
green in its highest point overhead.</p>

<p>Again we found ourselves on another large dome of
eruptive rock, in some places reduced into fine tobacco-coloured
powder, getting somewhat darker in colour
where the under stratum was of sand and soft conglomerate
easily crumbled under pressure, and containing
pellets of black ferruginous rock and grains of iron.
Large blocks of iron rock were exposed to the air in
many places.</p>

<p>We arrived at the third Salesian colony of St. Jos&eacute;
or Sangrador, near which was a small settlement of
Brazilians&mdash;a bad lot indeed. One of my best horses
was stolen here, and I was never able to recover it.
I remained in that unpleasant place for three days,
endeavouring to recover the animal, but it was of no
avail.</p>

<p>The Salesians had a handsome property, the agricultural
resources of which they were fast developing.
Sugar-cane, mandioca, rice, beans, and Indian corn
were raised with success. Father Antonio Malan,
Inspector-General of the Salesians, arrived from the
west, via Cuyab&aacute;. He was an extremely intelligent
and enterprising man&mdash;who should be congratulated on
selecting such excellent sites for the various colonies,
as well as for the sensible, businesslike fashion in
which the colonies were conducted. They were indeed
the only few bright spots where the light of civilization
shone in those sadly abandoned regions.</p>

<p>Here are the meagre entries in my diary for the
two following days:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-310" id="Pg_1-310"></a>[<a href="images/1-310.png">310</a>]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>May 29th. Remained at Sangrador in search of
missing horse. Temperature: min. 54&deg;; max. 83&deg;
Fahr. Perfectly clear sky.</p>

<p>May 30th. Obliged to remain one more day at
Sangrador. Horse missing still. All men have gone
searching the forest for it. Temperature: min. 56&frac12;&deg;
Fahr; max. 75&deg; Fahr. Elevation 2,050 ft.</p>

<p>It was indeed a great treat to be able to converse
with so intelligent a gentleman as Father Malan after
the company I had been in since leaving Goyaz.</p>

<p>Father Malan was a man with a heart of gold and
great courage. Under him the Salesians will some day
continue their good work and spread happiness and
culture among the few Indians who now remain in
Matto Grosso. What had already been done by the
Salesians was amazing. No doubt, with their great
enterprise, they would certainly continue their good
work of civilization and science combined.</p>

<p>Although the Salesians tried hard to induce men to
accompany my expedition, their efforts were rewarded
with no success; so that I had to be content with the
handful of men I had with me. I foresaw disaster
from that moment, for thirty was the least number of
men I needed to carry out my work properly&mdash;and
thirty good men at that. Instead, I only had six men,
two of them extraordinarily plucky but quite uncontrollable;
the others absolutely worthless.</p>

<p>Had I been a wise man I should have turned back.
But I am not a wise man, and I never turn back; so
that there only remained one thing to do&mdash;go on as
best I could, come what might.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Wild Animals&mdash;An Immense Chasm&mdash;Interesting Cloud Effects</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> May 31st (thermometer min. 56&deg;, max. 74&deg; Fahr.)
I decided to abandon the missing horse and proceed on
my journey. I suspected, with reason, that the animal
had been stolen. It was no use wasting any more time
searching for it. We thus bade good-bye for good to
the Salesians, and left the great basin of the Sangrador
River (elev. 2,050 ft.).</p>

<p>We travelled over sparsely wooded country to
2,350 ft. Tobacco-coloured soil was still under our feet,
yellow spattered lava, then again reddish soil, wonderfully
rich and fertile, if only it could be cultivated.
The country was here peculiar for its many undulations
until we arrived on the rim of a large basin, extending
from north-west to south-east, of great campos, with
stunted vegetation at first, but later with a truly
luxuriant growth of vigorous-looking <i>Jtauba preta</i>
(<i>Oreodaphne Hookeriana</i> Meissn.), with thick deep green
foliage.</p>

<p>We crossed two streamlets flowing north. On going
uphill we travelled on masses of volcanic pellets (elev.
2,500 ft.). To the south we could see a number of hills,
the sides of which showed the great effects of erosion
by wind and water. Nearly all those hill ranges<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-312" id="Pg_1-312"></a>[<a href="images/1-312.png">312</a>]</span>
extended from east to west. A long depression could
be observed cutting them from north to south.</p>

<p>That was a fine day for cloud effects, especially along
the horizon, where they displayed horizontal lines,
while they had great ball-like tops. Higher up, to
the north-west, was feathery mist turning the sky to
a delicate pale blue. A heavy, immense stratum of
cloud in four perfectly parallel terraces extended on
the arc from west to north.</p>

<p>We descended into a <i>cuvette</i> with the usual cluster
of vegetation in the centre and campos around. To
the south-west of that <i>cuvette</i> was an elongated but
well-rounded mountain, extending from east to west,
and beyond, to the S.S.W., in the far distance, an
almost identical replica of it. We travelled on deep
volcanic sand on the west slope of the <i>cuvette</i> and in
deep ashes at the bottom until we arrived at the Sangradorzinho
River, flowing north.</p>

<p>June 1st (thermometer min. 55&frac12;&deg; Fahr.; max. 74&deg;;
elev. 2,150 ft.). Heavy mist and rain-clouds, heavy
and sultry atmosphere. Sky almost entirely covered
by clouds.</p>

<p>Owing to trouble among my followers and waiting
for one of my men, who had remained behind in a last
effort to find the missing horse, we were unable to
leave camp until nearly noon. We rose to an elevation
of 2,400 ft., leaving behind the great <i>cuvette</i>, and marching
over parallel domes extending from north to south.
Between those domes in the depressions were sandy
<i>cuvettes</i> of verdant grass and the usual central <i>bosquets</i>.</p>

<p>Cinders and sand were still plentiful, with stunted,
thin trees growing upon them. Several times that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-313" id="Pg_1-313"></a>[<a href="images/1-313.png">313</a>]</span>
day we reached an elevation of 2,550 ft. After passing
a streamlet flowing north, we kept at that elevation for
a considerable distance, after which, having descended
100 ft. (2,450 ft.), we found ourselves in a most enchanting,
oval-shaped <i>cuvette</i> of cinders well covered with
fresh verdure, and in its centre from north to south a
row of <i>burity</i> palms.</p>

<p>That was indeed a day of great surprises in the way
of scenery. No sooner had we left that beautiful
<i>cuvette</i> than we came to a magnificent flat open valley
extending from E.S.E. to W.N.W. In its northern
part, where a pool of stagnant water was to be found,
were innumerable <i>burity</i> palms. It was evident that
during the rainy season that plain (elev. 2,350 ft.)
must be entirely under water. In many places it was
swampy, even at the time of my visit. It was most
refreshing to the eyes to see such expanses of lovely
green healthy grass. The mules and horses enjoyed
it more than we did, neighing to their hearts' content
when we emerged into the great verdant meadow.
They tore away with their teeth at the delicious grass
as they cantered along gaily.</p>

<p>Some of the enjoyment of the delightful scenery
was taken away from me&mdash;not only that day, but
every day during almost an entire year&mdash;owing to the
stupid obstinacy of my men. They carried their
magazine rifles fully loaded&mdash;eight cartridges in each&mdash;and
while marching insisted on keeping the rifles
cocked; they would not hear of keeping them at
safety&mdash;so that any extra jerk or a twig of a tree catching
the trigger might cause the weapons to go off at
any moment. This would have mattered little if they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-314" id="Pg_1-314"></a>[<a href="images/1-314.png">314</a>]</span>
had slung their rifles in the usual way, pointing skyward
or else towards the earth. But no-one could
never induce a Brazilian to do things in a sensible way.
No, indeed; they must carry their rifles horizontally
upon the shoulder, the muzzles of the nearest weapons
always pointing at me. It was no use remonstrating,
as they might perhaps have misunderstood it as
fear. So all I could do was to trust in Providence. I
could not have done better, for Providence indeed
watched over me and protected me on that expedition
in a most merciful way&mdash;for which I am truly grateful.
On several occasions&mdash;as was to be expected from the
careless way in which the weapons were carried&mdash;now
one rifle then another went off unexpectedly, and I
came mighty near being shot. On other occasions the
mules had narrow escapes. Once a bullet went right
through the hat of one of my men, just missing his head.</p>

<p>In any case, I beg the reader to realize how pleasant
it was to have the muzzle of a loaded rifle, ready to be
fired, pointing at you in front for an average of eight
to twelve hours a day for several months. I generally
rode last in the caravan in order to prevent straggling,
and also to see that any baggage which fell off the
pack-saddles was recovered. This was unpleasant in
more ways than one. First the clouds of dust raised by
the animals as we marched over the sand and cinders,
which filled my eyes, mouth and nose; then the constant
attention to watch for lost baggage&mdash;besides the work
of writing my notes as we rode along. The sound of
the dangling bells of the mules was monotonous to a
degree, and so was the aspect of the animals' tails
swinging and slashing from one side to the other in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-315" id="Pg_1-315"></a>[<a href="images/1-315.png">315</a>]</span>
order to drive away tormenting flies. Occasionally,
when stung fiercely by a horse-fly, one or two animals
would dash away wildly, tearing off in their career low
branches of trees and even altogether knocking down
good-sized trees, four or five inches in diameter.</p>

<p>This would seem impossible in any other country,
but not in Brazil, where the majority of the trees were
nearly entirely eaten up inside by ants. The roots,
owing to the substratum of lava spread horizontally
near the surface, offered little resistance to side pressure
upon the tree itself, so that frequently even the weight
of a man leaning against a tree was sufficient to knock
it down. I never shall forget how impressed I was the
first time I saw my men cut the way through the forest,
slashing down right and left good-sized trees with one
swing each of their <i>falcon</i>&mdash;heavy-bladed knives some
2 ft. long.</p>

<p>What terrific strength! I thought, until I happened
to lean against a tree, and down went the tree and
myself too. Upon examination I found that merely
the bark remained, with a few filaments inside&mdash;the
rest of the interior having been entirely devoured by
ants. Yet some of the top branches seemed still alive,
and had leaves. Again, even when quite sound, those
trees were extremely an&aelig;mic and soft, quite watery
inside, and could be cut almost as easily as celery.</p>

<p>This does not mean that all the trees of Brazil were
worthless. No, indeed. These remarks apply merely
to that particular portion of Brazil in which I was then
travelling&mdash;where, barring the <i>burity</i> palms in the
moist lands and marshes, the trees were mostly
rickety and dwarfed, with mouldy barks, malformed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-316" id="Pg_1-316"></a>[<a href="images/1-316.png">316</a>]</span>
limbs, and scanty leaves. That is why, when we came
to the healthy mass of <i>burity</i> palms and the lovely
young grass, one felt just the same as when, after
having been through a hospital, one emerges into the
fresh air among healthy people.</p>

<p>That night we encamped on the heavenly meadow.
We felt we had reached Paradise. For the first time
great flocks of parrots and gorgeously-coloured macaws
played about and enlivened the air with their shrill
whistles and shrieks, and flew over the palms, gently
swung to and fro by the wind. Then innumerable
<i>colibris</i>&mdash;the tiny humming-birds, of marvellous iridescent
metallic tints&mdash;sucked now from one then from
another flower while still flying. Indeed, that spot
seemed the rendez-vous of all the animals of that region.
There you found <i>on&ccedil;as</i> (jaguar), <i>anta</i> (a large pachyderm),
the <i>Tapirus Americanus</i>, the <i>tamandua bandeira</i>,
with its worm-like tongue, (or <i>Myrmecophaga jubata</i>),
and plenty of <i>veado</i> (<i>Cervus elaphus</i>). The footmarks
of all those animals were innumerable near the water.</p>

<p>The man I had left behind in order to make a further
attempt at recovering the lost horse arrived that evening,
his search having been unsuccessful. Undoubtedly
the horse had been stolen.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill1-316.jpg"><img src="images/ill1-316_th.jpg" alt="Strange Geometrical Pattern of Lava over Giant Volcanic Dome." title="Strange Geometrical Pattern of Lava over Giant Volcanic Dome." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Strange Geometrical Pattern of Lava over Giant Volcanic Dome.</p>
<hr />
<p>Although the place where we had made camp was
a regular paradise to look at&mdash;in the day-time&mdash;it
might have been compared to warmer regions at night.
Mosquitoes of all sizes and of all degrees of viciousness
rose in swarms from the swamp at sunset, and made
our life absolutely miserable. To counterbalance the
torture we had a wonderful sunset to look at. First
the sky, of a golden colour, was intersected by graceful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-317" id="Pg_1-317"></a>[<a href="images/1-317.png">317</a>]</span>
curves dividing it into sections like a melon; then it
gradually became overladen with horizontal black and
crimson lines to the west, black to the east and overhead.</p>

<p>June the 2nd was my birthday. I am superstitious
by nature, and I would have given anything to celebrate
it with some lucky event, although I was at
a loss to think of anything lucky that could have
happened to me there. Indeed, I began my new year
badly&mdash;much worse even than I expected. That was
an ill-omen to me. First of all there was a terrible
row among my men in camp. They had taken to their
rifles. They wanted to shoot the cook. The man
deserved punishment, perhaps, but not quite so severe
a one. After a great deal of arguing I quieted them and
got them to lay down their weapons. The cook's life
was spared&mdash;worse luck for me. I was sorry for it
when I had my breakfast, for cooking more diabolical
than his could not be imagined. During breakfast
the news came that another horse of my caravan had
been lost. So there was the prospect of another day
wasted to recover it. My men were unable to trace
it, so I resigned myself to the monetary loss and also
to the inconvenience its absence would cause us.</p>

<p>My men felt the cold intensely during the night,
the thermometer being as low as 51&deg; Fahr. (minimum).
During the day the maximum temperature was 85&deg;
Fahr. and 96&deg; in the sun.</p>

<p>My only consolation that day was watching the
innumerable birds and gazing at the magnificent sunset.
The latter consisted that evening of three lines forming
arches&mdash;two black to the west and the third white&mdash;stretching
across the sky from north to south. From<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-318" id="Pg_1-318"></a>[<a href="images/1-318.png">318</a>]</span>
the higher black line radiations spread, subdividing
the sky into rectangular designs&mdash;of almost equal size.
To the east were great globular masses of mist somewhat
confused in shape.</p>

<p>The water at this camp was bad, the marsh being
over a bed of decayed vegetable matter, which rendered
the water of a brownish black colour, like strong tea.
Its taste was foul. By digging a well a few yards from
the lagoon I succeeded, however, in obtaining clean and
good water, which filtered through the ashes and sand.</p>

<p>Our camp was at an elevation of 2,300 ft. During
the night, June 2nd-3rd, the thermometer was higher
than usual (min. 58&deg; Fahr.), but my men felt the cold
more than the previous night because of the heavy
mist which set in after sunset, followed by a drizzling
rain which damped everything. My men were all
attacked by fever, which rendered them more irritable
and ill-tempered than ever&mdash;if possible.</p>

<p>We did not leave camp until 11.30 a.m., rising again
to the summit of the plateau some 50 ft. higher. There
we had to describe a wide arc of a circle, as through
the trees we perceived on our left an immense chasm,
beyond which was a much disturbed landscape of striking
ruggedness. We could see a huge circular crater with
eroded lips, rising like the chipped edges of a gigantic
cup, in the centre of the great volcanic basin. That
depression with high vertical walls all round displayed a
large gap to the W.N.W. and another to the south-west.</p>

<p>Twelve kilometres from our last camp&mdash;and still
marching along the edge of the circle on the summit of
the plateau&mdash;we came to a grassy <i>cuvette</i>, and then to
another hollow with a few <i>burity</i> palms. The wall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-319" id="Pg_1-319"></a>[<a href="images/1-319.png">319</a>]</span>
overlooking the great circular depression was perpendicular,
of red igneous rock, with projecting spurs ending
in conical, much-corrugated hills. The curious opening
to the south-west was much broken up in two places
with gaps. In the distance beyond were three ranges of
hills, the colour of which appeared a pure cobalt blue.</p>

<p>The central crater was formed by rugged red walls
with spurs on the east and south-east sides. In the
bottom was water with trees all round its edge. There
were four square holes from which boiling water
gurgled like feeble geysers, and three more holes of a
more irregular shape.</p>

<p>The hill range on which we stood projected well
into the centre of the great circular basin. It had on
the west side perfectly vertical walls of black igneous
rock. Its summit was chiefly formed of ferruginous
erupted rock thrown up while in a state of ebullition,
which had cooled into a conglomerate of minute globular
masses, in shape like the bubbles of boiling water. The
great circle around us, as we stood on the outermost
point of the projecting spur, was most impressive, with
its brilliantly coloured red walls.</p>

<p>My men killed a <i>coat&iacute;</i>&mdash;a peculiar, long-nosed carnivorous
animal, which had characteristics in common
with dogs, monkeys, and pigs. There were two kinds of
<i>coat&iacute;</i> or <i>guat&iacute;</i>, viz. the <i>coat&iacute; de mundeo</i> (<i>Nasua solitaria</i>),
and the <i>coat&iacute; de bando</i> (<i>Nasua socialis</i>). Ours was a
<i>Nasua solitaria</i>. It was a beautiful little animal, about
the size of a small cat, with a wonderfully soft brown
coat on its back, a yellowish red belly and bright
yellow chest and throat. The chin was as white as
snow. The long tail, 1&frac12; ft. long&mdash;was in black and yellow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-320" id="Pg_1-320"></a>[<a href="images/1-320.png">320</a>]</span>
rings. It possessed powerful fangs on both the upper
and lower jaws, a long, black, gritty or granular tongue,
short ears, powerful short fore-paws with long nails&mdash;quite
dog-like; long thighs extremely strong, short
hips and hind legs, with callosity up to the knee&mdash;evidently
to allow that part of the leg to rest flat upon
the ground. The <i>coat&iacute;</i> had velvety black eyes of great
beauty, well set in its small well-shaped head. It was
a wild little fellow, extremely agile, and could kill a
dog much larger than itself with comparative ease.</p>

<p>We circled the eastern and northern part of the
great cauldron, always remaining on the summit of
the plateau at elevations varying from 2,250 to 2,300 ft.
We came upon patches of violet-coloured and then
tobacco-coloured sand, and also upon quantities of
dark brown sand, generally consolidated into easily
friable rock. There were the usual deposits of grey
ashes over the underlying volcanic rock which peeped
through here and there.</p>

<p>On June 4th we were at the Cabe&ccedil;eira Koiteh (temperature,
min. 53&deg; Fahr.; max. 80&deg; Fahr.; elev. 2,100 ft.).
Close to this camp, from an outstretching spur, I
obtained another magnificent view. To the E.S.E.
stretched from north-east to south-west a flat
plateau, and to the east a flat mountainous block with
an eroded passage. Headlands branched off from the
northern side of the ridges in a north-easterly direction.
Between them were basins thickly wooded in their lower
depressions. The north-eastern portion of the flat
range was almost vertical, with many angular and
sharply pointed spurs projecting from it.</p>

<p>In the centre of the greater basin, of which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-321" id="Pg_1-321"></a>[<a href="images/1-321.png">321</a>]</span>
others were details, a low convex ridge bulged out,
with three conical peaks&mdash;two of them at the highest
point of the curve. Between the first and second
cone two twin sub-craters were visible&mdash;evidently the
two twin circles had formed part of the same crater&mdash;in
the mountain side of the distant range. A third
crater was some distance off to the south-west.</p>

<p>To the south-west in the background was a lovely
view of flat highlands with huge tower-like rocks
standing upright upon them. Then to the S.S.W. a
regular vertical dyke of rock stood on the top of an
elongated conical base.</p>

<p>The elevation on the summit of the spur from
which we obtained this lovely panorama was 2,200 ft.&mdash;or
no more than 100 ft. higher than our camp.</p>

<p>We travelled again that same day on the northern
edge of the great depression, and met three more
<i>cuvettes</i> of grey ashes with an abundant central growth of
<i>buritys</i>. These were at a general elevation of 2,300 ft.,
the bottom of the depression being 50 ft. lower. On
descending from the table-land, through a gap we discerned
far away to the south a long flat-topped plateau
extending from south-west to north-east and having
a precipitous wall-face.</p>

<p>We got down to the Caxoeirinha stream, where we
found an abandoned hut in the eroded hollow of the
stream. The water flowed there over a bed of red
lava and extremely hard conglomerate rock made up
of lava pebbles and solidified ashes. Above this at
the sides of the stream was a stratum some 10 ft. thick
of grey ashes, and above it a stratum 2 ft. thick of
red volcanic dust and sand.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-322" id="Pg_1-322"></a>[<a href="images/1-322.png">322</a>]</span>
As we got higher again and I stood on a projecting
promontory, another wonderful view spread itself
before me. The sun, nearly setting, in glorious white
radiations, cast deep blue and violet-coloured shadows
upon the great abyss to my right (N.W.) which was
a kilometre or more in diameter and more than 300 ft.
deep&mdash;surely another great crater. It seemed as if a
natural wall of rock must have once existed, joining
the promontory on which I stood to the great mass
of prismatic red volcanic rock to the west of us, and
ending in a flat triangle with a wide base. The surface
soil on the height of the peninsula was of spattered
lava and black broiled rock and pellets.</p>

<p>The bottom of the abyss formed two sweeping
undulations&mdash;the second from the centre much higher
than the first&mdash;seemingly a great wave of lava vomited
by the crater, by which probably the destruction of
the wall joining the peninsula had been caused.</p>

<p>To the S.S.E. in the distance stood a high mountain
range&mdash;or rather a great flat-topped plateau of
delicious cobalt blue shades, almost losing itself in
the sky. To the east, completing the circle, were two
other great spurs of red-baked rock, with precipitous,
almost vertical, sides and with much-striated buttresses
that ended in conical mounds&mdash;eroded into that shape
by the action of water and wind.</p>

<p>To the south, beyond, a sloping table-land with a
pronounced dip eastward extended from east to west.
It towered over everything, and was shaped like a
trapezium. In front of this sloping table-land was
another long flat-topped range, stretching from E.S.E.
to W.N.W. Again in front of this, could be seen an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-323" id="Pg_1-323"></a>[<a href="images/1-323.png">323</a>]</span>
interesting series of prismatic mounds&mdash;like parallel
barriers. To the S.S.W. rose a large mountainous mass&mdash;another
plateau. Then came a second range, cut
into clear pyramids with rectangular bases, and,
beyond, a great expanse of lovely green with some
large mounds of a similar shape to those already described.
Two more pyramids were also to be observed
far, far in the distance, while others of a slightly less
angular shape were noticeable upon the great flat
stretch due west.</p>

<p>Right under us, at the bottom of the precipice,
was thick forest covering, zigzag fashion, the two
depressions, roughly in a general direction of south-east
to north-west. Those two depressions drained that
immense basin. It was there that the streamlet
Caxoeirinha had its birth. The Caxoeirinha flowed
north-west and fell into the Ponte de Pedra River,
which flowed south. Those two streams, with a
number of others, formed the head-waters of the great
S. Louren&ccedil;o River, a formidable tributary of the Rio
Paraguay or Paran&aacute;.</p>

<p>An extraordinary effect of clouds could be seen
that day, and a similar occurrence I saw on many other
occasions upon the table-lands of Matto Grosso. The
clouds reproduced&mdash;upside-down&mdash;the configuration of
the country directly underneath them. That was due,
no doubt, to the air currents diverted by the obstacles
on the earth's surface, which caused the masses of
mist above to assume similar forms&mdash;but of course, as
I have said, upside-down.</p>

<p>We were still at an elevation of 2,150 ft. The
temperature during the night went down to 52&deg; Fahr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-324" id="Pg_1-324"></a>[<a href="images/1-324.png">324</a>]</span>
My men, as usual, suffered intensely from the cold&mdash;at
least, judging by the noise they made, the moans
and groans and chattering of teeth. They nearly all
had violent toothache. Alcides, too, apparently went
through agony, but he showed a little more manliness
than the rest and did not make quite such a pitiful
exhibition of himself.</p>

<p>It was curious how certain racial characteristics
were difficult to suppress in individuals. Alcides had
some German blood in him&mdash;rather far removed. He
could not speak German, nor did he know anything
about Germany. Yet German characteristics came
out in him constantly. For instance, the uncontrollable
desire to write his own name and that of his
lady-love on trees and rocks all along our passage.
Alcides was really very good at calligraphy, and some
of his inscriptions and ornamentations were real works
of art. Many half-hours did we have to waste at the
different camps, waiting for Alcides to finish up the
record of his passage in that country, and many blades
of penknives&mdash;I had a good supply of them to give as
presents to natives&mdash;did he render useless in incising
the lettering on the trees and stones.</p>

<p class="fsc">Author's Troop of Animals wading across a Shallow Stream.</p>
<hr />
<p>Filippe the negro&mdash;who was the best-natured of the
lot&mdash;had become quite swelled-headed with the big
salary he received. Arithmetic was not his forte. As
he could hardly write, he was trying to work out, with
a number of sticks&mdash;each representing one day's salary&mdash;how
much money he had already earned, and how
much more he was likely to earn. It evidently seemed
to him a large fortune&mdash;indeed it was&mdash;and his plans
of what he would do with all that money in the future<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-325" id="Pg_1-325"></a>[<a href="images/1-325.png">325</a>]</span>
were amusing. First of all, the <i>id&eacute;e fixe</i> in his mind
was the purchase of a <i>mallettinha</i>, a small trunk with
a strong lock, in which to keep his money and his
clothes. I took advantage of this to tell Filippe&mdash;they
were all just like spoiled children&mdash;that the best
place for <i>mallettinhas</i> was Manaos, our chief objective
on the River Amazon, some 1,800 kil. away from that
point as the crow flew, and about four times, at least,
that distance by the way we should travel. Many
times a day I had to repeat to Filippe glowing descriptions
of the wonders of the <i>mallettinhas</i>, and I got him
so enamoured of the <i>mallettinhas</i> to be got at Manaos
that I made certain that Filippe at least would come
along and not leave me. I was sure of one thing&mdash;that
nowhere in the intervening country would he be able
to procure himself a little trunk&mdash;nor, indeed, could
one procure oneself anything else.</p>

<p>I supplied my men with ample tobacco. Filippe
was all day and a great part of the night smoking a
pipe. Owing to constant quarrels among my men, I
had turned him into a cook. When in camp he had
to sit hour after hour watching the boiling of the <i>feij&atilde;o</i>.
Enveloped in clouds of smoke, Filippe with his pipe
sat in a reverie, dreaming about the <i>mallettinha</i>. He
was quite a good fellow, and at any rate he did work
when ordered.</p>

<p>All my men had been given small pocket mirrors&mdash;without
which no Brazilian will travel anywhere. It
was amusing to watch them, a hundred times a day,
gazing at the reflection of their faces in the glasses. It
was nevertheless somewhat trying to one's temper
when one ordered a man to do something and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-326" id="Pg_1-326"></a>[<a href="images/1-326.png">326</a>]</span>
had to watch him for an endless time admiring his own
features in the little mirror, and one had to repeat the
order half a dozen times before the glass was duly
cleaned with his elbow or upon his trousers and set at
rest, and the order carelessly obeyed. Even Alcides&mdash;who
was far superior to the others in education&mdash;could
not be kept away from his mirror. While riding he
would all the time be gazing at his features instead of
looking at the beautiful scenery around us.</p>

<p>On leaving camp we again reached the summit of
the plateau (elev. 2,300 ft.), with its patches of red
volcanic earth, violet-coloured sand, and snuff-coloured
dust&mdash;extremely fine in quality. After crossing a streamlet
flowing south, we again continued our journey on the
flat plateau, slightly higher at that point, or 2,400 ft.</p>

<p>We were in the great plain crossed by the Ponte de
Pedra rivulet, flowing southward. Once more we obtained
a gorgeous view looking south. Four parallel
ranges stretching roughly from south-east to north-west
stood in all their grandeur before us. They were of
brilliant red volcanic rock. On the second range, from
us, rose a curious square block of rock of gigantic size,
resembling a castle with its door and all. In the
distance, to the south-west, erosion seemed to have
taken place on a great scale in the side of the table-land.</p>

<p>The highest point we had so far reached on the
plateau on which we were travelling since leaving the
Araguaya was 2,400 ft. There again we found another
of the extensive grassy <i>cuvettes</i>&mdash;the flat bottom of
which was only 30 ft. lower than the highest point
of the plateau. A luxuriant growth of <i>burity</i> palms
and <i>birero</i> trees adorned the centre, the latter very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-327" id="Pg_1-327"></a>[<a href="images/1-327.png">327</a>]</span>
tall and handsome, with smooth white bark and only a
dense tuft of dark green foliage at their tops. In the
<i>cuvettes</i> I saw, the growth of the tall vegetation invariably
ran the long way of the oval.</p>

<p>The sky that evening showed great streaks of
transparent lines of mist from west to east, the central
radiation of these being formed of lines so precisely
parallel that they seemed to have been drawn with
rule and dividers. Directly overhead those lines
gradually blended into a more indefinite mass. The
radiations did not begin from the vanishing sun on the
horizon, nor at the point diametrically opposite on the
east, but began to appear only one-tenth up the entire
circle of the sky, both west and east.</p>

<p>Almost globular cloudlets, with the lower section
cut off in a horizontal plane&mdash;quite typical, as we have
seen, of the cloud formation on that Central Brazilian
plateau&mdash;crowded the sky, quite low to the north, and
also a great many small ball-like clouds which showed
with some brilliancy against the blue sky.</p>

<p>The sunsets in Central Brazil were to me always a
source of intense joy, interest, and admiration. With
certain characteristics which repeated themselves frequently,
they always displayed wonderful effects of
light and a most peculiar formation of clouds.</p>

<p>Before reaching camp we passed another oval
<i>cuvette</i> with a longitudinal row of trees&mdash;so green and
tidy as to be just like a portion of a well-kept English
park (elev. 2,350 ft.). Another bit of wonderful scenery,
with immense prismatic rocky mountains&mdash;really more
like dykes&mdash;appeared in the distance; and also a
vertical walled mountain in the foreground.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A Beautiful Lagoon&mdash;Strange Lunar Display&mdash;Waves of Lava&mdash;Curious
Grottoes&mdash;Rock Carvings&mdash;A Beautiful Waterfall</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> camped at the Lagoa Formosa&mdash;or "Beautiful
Lagoon"&mdash;a large, verdant, oval-shaped lagoon, entirely
covered with grass, only 140 ft. lower than the top of
the plateau (elev. 2,290 ft.). Barring a slight undulation
in the land to the north-east of the marsh, the
country was there absolutely flat.</p>

<p>At night I witnessed a marvellous lunar effect. The
half-moon was high up in the sky. Soon after sunset
two immense concentric arches of mist, with their
centres on the horizon to the east, shone like silver
rings, their upper edges being lighted by the bluish
light of the moon. With the reflection of this in the
still waters of the lagoon, the effect was enchanting
and intensely picturesque.</p>

<p>My men suffered a great deal from the damp&mdash;they
were always suffering from everything: from the
heat of the sun, the rain, the cold, the long marches.</p>

<p>That night we had a minimum temperature of
51&deg; Fahr., the elevation of our camp being 2,150 ft.</p>

<p>Naturally, over the expanse of water the sunrise
was wonderful. The sky was well covered by feathery
radiations from the north-east, which were intersected
by striations shooting skyward from east to west and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-329" id="Pg_1-329"></a>[<a href="images/1-329.png">329</a>]</span>
forming a charming design. The radiations from the
north-east reached right across the sky as far as the
horizon to the south-west. What astonished me most
in Matto Grosso was the characteristic immobility of
the clouds. In the day-time they remained sometimes
for hours with hardly any changes or movement. As
soon as the sun appeared, rendering the lower sky of
a golden yellow and of vivid Indian red above, the
northern part of the lagoon was enveloped in mist,
which rose in angular blocks, vertical on the south
side, slanting at a sharp angle on the north. These
pointed peaks of mist remained immobile&mdash;as if they
had been solid&mdash;until the sun was well up in the sky.</p>

<p>I went once more to gaze at the glorious panorama.
In the morning light new and important details were
revealed, such as a strange series of dykes of a prismatic
shape, of which I could count as many as seven. Great
transverse depressions or grooves&mdash;from S.S.E. to
N.N.W., with a dip S.S.E.&mdash;could in that light be now
plainly detected, and this time two great square castles
of rock&mdash;instead of one&mdash;were disclosed upon the third
range of undulations.</p>

<p>The high ridge to the south-west displayed a subsidence
on a large scale in its central portion, where
bare vertical red walls had been left standing on each
side.</p>

<p>Then there were other curious concave depressions
or gateways formed in the great table-land&mdash;which had
for its marked characteristic concave curves on all its
slopes.</p>

<p>On leaving camp&mdash;nearly at noon, after a serious
quarrel and fight among my men, which left me worried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-330" id="Pg_1-330"></a>[<a href="images/1-330.png">330</a>]</span>
to death by the petty nonsense and incessant grumbling
of my followers&mdash;we journeyed at an elevation of
2,300 ft., finding shortly after an almost circular <i>cuvette</i>
of deep grey cinders, 100 ft. deep (elevation at the
bottom 2,200 ft.).</p>

<p>Twelve kilometres farther on we came upon another
great depression extending from east to west, with an
enormous belt of grassy land. There was the usual
cluster of trees and palms in the centre, but larger
than usual. To the south were campos&mdash;lovely
prairies&mdash;with sparse and stunted trees&mdash;chiefly <i>Goma
arabica</i> or acacias.</p>

<p>The elevation of the upper edge of the <i>cuvette</i> was
2,500 ft., that of the bottom 2,450 ft. We continued
our journey on the top of the plateau, with slight
undulations varying in height from 50 to 70 ft. Snuff-coloured
soil and red sand were invariably noticeable
on the higher points, and grey ashes in the lower points,
where erosion had caused depressions.</p>

<p>Then, farther on, the plateau, with an elevation of
2,450 ft., was absolutely flat for several kilometres, and
showed sparse vegetation and miserable-looking an&aelig;mic
trees&mdash;the thin soil over solid rock affording them inadequate
nourishment.</p>

<p>Eighteen kilometres from our last camp we came
upon another oval basin (elev. 2,400 ft. above the sea
level), extending longitudinally from N.N.E. to S.S.W.
On its huge deposits of cinders grew deliciously green,
fresh-looking, healthy grass, and a thick clump of
<i>burity</i> palms, and <i>birero</i> trees of immense height and
thick foliage. Those beautiful trees were called by the
people of Goyaz "<i>cutib&aacute;</i>" and "<i>pintahyba</i>." They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-331" id="Pg_1-331"></a>[<a href="images/1-331.png">331</a>]</span>
were marvellous in their wonderful alignment among the
surrounding circle of gorgeous palms. The latter were
in their turn screened in their lower part by a belt
of low scrub&mdash;so that upon looking at that oasis one
could hardly realize that it had not been geometrically
laid out by the hands of a skilful gardener.</p>

<p>On the outer rim of the <i>cuvette</i>&mdash;away from the
moisture&mdash;hundreds, in fact, thousands of cones, cylinders
and domes, from 4 to 6 ft. high, the work of ants,
could be seen, all constructed of bluish grey ashes.</p>

<p>We had here a wonderful example, quite sufficient
to persuade the most sceptical, of the influence of
agglomerations of trees in the formation of clouds.
The sky was perfectly clear everywhere except directly
above the extensive cluster of trees in the large <i>cuvette</i>.
Quite low down&mdash;only a hundred feet or so above the
top of the trees&mdash;there hung a heavy white cloud. It
was a windless day. The cloud ended on all sides
exactly where the trees ended, as sharply as if it had
been cut with a knife. It looked exactly like a rectangular
canopy over the luxuriant vegetation. This
appearance was intensified by undulations in the lower
part of the cloud, like festoons.</p>

<p>In proceeding across the immense circular <i>cuvette</i>
I found that the central line of thick vegetation formed
an angle. A streamlet of delicious crystal-like water
emerged from among the trees. On its bank lay the
skeletons of three mules, suggesting a tragedy.</p>

<p>On leaving the great <i>cuvette</i> we rose again to the top
of the plateau, 2,550 ft. above sea level. On descending
from a large dome to the west over red volcanic
sand and red earth, half consolidated into rock easily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-332" id="Pg_1-332"></a>[<a href="images/1-332.png">332</a>]</span>
friable under slight pressure, we were once more travelling
across immense campos in a depression of fine
cinders and earth, extending from north to south, at an
elevation of 2,400 ft. We further traversed two other
less important depressions, the deepest being at an
elevation of 2,350 ft.</p>

<p>The jutting headlands of the plateau on which we
had travelled were all most precipitous&mdash;nearly vertical&mdash;and
of solid dark red volcanic rock.</p>

<p>A magnificent view next confronted us to the south.
A huge black square block with a crater was before
us, and there appeared what seemed to me to be the
remaining sections of a huge volcanic vent and several
smaller funnels. The lower lip of the crater formed a
terrace. Then another wider crater could be perceived
in a circular hollow of the spur of the plateau on
which we had travelled, and which stretched out into
the underlying plain. That spur extended from north-east
to south-west, and in it two circular hollows of
great size could be noticed, the sides of which were
deeply fluted.</p>

<p>During the entire march that day we had seen
quantities of violet-coloured deposits made up of tiny
crystals, carbonized and pulverized rock and ferruginous
dust.</p>

<hr />
<p>On descending from the summit of the plateau, by
a very steep slope, we saw many shrubs of <i>sapatinho</i>, a
medicinal plant of the genus <i>euphorbiace&aelig;</i> (Euphorbia),
growing in the interstices of red igneous rock, and
among quantities of d&eacute;bris of marble, crystals, and
eruptive pebbles.</p>

<p>During the night we had a magnificent lunar display.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-333" id="Pg_1-333"></a>[<a href="images/1-333.png">333</a>]</span>
There was a good deal of moisture in the air, and
mist. First of all a gorgeous lunar halo was observed,
which later vanished to leave room for a most extraordinary
geometrical design upon the partly moon-illuminated
clouds and masses of mist. A most perfect
luminous equilateral triangle appeared, with its apex
downwards to the west and the half-moon in the
central point of the base-line of the triangle above.
On either side of the apex of the triangle faint concentric
circles blended away into the sky near the horizon.
Later in the night that curious effect disappeared and a
multiple lunar rainbow of amazing beauty and perfection
was to be admired.</p>

<p>In ecstasy at the beautiful sight, and in a moment
of forgetfulness, I drew the attention of my men to
the wonderful spectacle.</p>

<p>"That's the moon!" they answered, with a snarl.
Talking among themselves, they contemptuously added:
"<i>He</i> has never seen the moon before!" and they went
on with the never-changing, blood-curdling tales of
murders which filled them nightly with delight.</p>

<p>The streamlet flowing south, on the bank of which
we camped, took its name of Sapatinho from the many
<i>sapatinho</i> trees which were in the neighbourhood. It
was a curious watercourse, which disappeared into a
tunnel in the rock, to reappear only farther off out of a
hole in a red lava-flow.</p>

<p>We had marched until late into the night, and it
was not until we arrived and made camp that I noticed
that Filippe the negro was missing. Several hours
elapsed, and as he had not turned up I feared that
something had happened to him. Had he been one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-334" id="Pg_1-334"></a>[<a href="images/1-334.png">334</a>]</span>
of the other men I should have thought it a case of
desertion; but Filippe was a good fellow, and I had
from the beginning felt that he and Alcides would
be the two faithful men on that expedition. I went
back alone a mile or two in the moonlight to try and
find him, but with no success.</p>

<p>At sunrise I ordered two men to go in search of him.
The fellows&mdash;who had no mercy whatever even for one
another&mdash;were loth to go back to look for their companion
and his mount. When they eventually started
they took a pick each to dig his grave in case they
found him dead. Fortunately they had only been
gone from camp a few minutes when I perceived Filippe
riding down the steep incline.</p>

<p>The minimum temperature was only 55&deg; Fahr.
during the night, but it was so damp that my men felt
the cold intensely, especially as there were gusts of a
sharp breeze from the north-east. Moreover, in the
deep hollow with thick grass in which we camped (elev.
2,200 ft. above the sea level) we suffered absolute torture
from the swarms of <i>carrapatos</i> of all sizes, mosquitoes,
and flies. The air and earth were thick with
them. The water was dirty and almost undrinkable,
as it passed through a lot of decomposing vegetation.</p>

<p>I was glad when Filippe reappeared and we were
able to leave that terrible spot. Great undulations were
now met with, 300 ft. and more in height.</p>

<p>Only 1&frac12; kil. farther on we came to the Presidente
stream, flowing south (elev. 2,100 ft.) over a bed of ashes,
while its banks were formed of thick deposits of finely
powdered yellow volcanic sand and dust.</p>

<p>We went over a huge dome covered with a stratum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-335" id="Pg_1-335"></a>[<a href="images/1-335.png">335</a>]</span>
of brown sand, exposing on its western side a large
wall of igneous rock with much-fissured strata dipping
to the north-west. Immense isolated rocks showed
vertical strata, demonstrating plainly that they had
been considerably disturbed at some epoch or other.</p>

<p>We were on the bank of another stream (elev. 1,950 ft.)
flowing south&mdash;the Capim Branco. We were then in
another great and deep basin extending from north-west
to south-east, in the north-western part of which
could be seen on the summit of the rounded hill-tops
and spurs an overlapping of rock, evidently produced
when in a molten condition. In the south-western
part of the slope encircling this great valley there stood
another great barrier, formed also by a flow of molten
rock curling over itself, as it were, and above this stood
angular and pointed shoots of molten stuff of a subsequent
origin. Large slabs of the latter could be
separated easily from the underlying flow.</p>

<p>From the summit of that rocky prominence was
obtained a lovely panorama of a great plateau, a portion
of which had been eroded into a wall (E.N.E.) with
three buttresses: another portion was gradually assuming
a similar shape. The plateau had a great spur
projecting westward. A crater had formed with a
broken-up side to the west, leaving the conical-shaped
remains of its fragmentary mouth. The plateau ended
after describing a sweeping curve&mdash;almost a semicircle.</p>

<p>In the centre of the immense basin before us were
successions of high undulations&mdash;like great waves&mdash;extending
southward in parallel lines (east to west).
From the point of vantage on which I stood I could
count as many as eight of those huge lines of waves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-336" id="Pg_1-336"></a>[<a href="images/1-336.png">336</a>]</span>
Evidently at some remote period&mdash;it would be difficult
to say how many thousands of years ago&mdash;that was a
gigantic mass of molten stuff in commotion. In many
places it was apparent that the great waves of molten
rock had flowed over and partly overlapped the lower
ones. In its higher north-easterly point the basin
was wooded.</p>

<p>The great basin extended southward. In that
direction all the lower ridges with their arched backs
showed a depression or dip. On the S.S.W. two
more great domes of wonderfully perfect curves were
to be observed, and on the south-west stood an
isolated gigantic quadrangular mountain of solid rock,
with the usual buttresses in the lower portion typical
of that region.</p>

<p>To the south-east a lovely square-shaped plateau
of marvellously graceful lines stood prominent in the
centre of the basin. In the same direction, only a
few hundred yards off, was a most peculiar angular
rock, which looked exactly like the magnified crest
of an immense wave. That was just what it had
been formerly&mdash;the wave, of course, of a gigantic
molten mass of rock, set in violent motion by an immeasurable
force. It was the terminal point of the
great succession of rocky waves which we had skirted
to the north in order to arrive at that point, and
which extended from the great semicircle we had
passed the previous day.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill1-336.jpg"><img src="images/ill1-336_th.jpg" alt="Strange Rock-Carvings of Matto Grosso." title="Strange Rock-Carvings of Matto Grosso." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Strange Rock-Carvings of Matto Grosso.</p>
<hr />
<p>At the terminal point of those rocky waves&mdash;or
wherever the rock was exposed&mdash;it was evident that
all those undulations had received a similar movement
and had formed the great backbone range of rock,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-337" id="Pg_1-337"></a>[<a href="images/1-337.png">337</a>]</span>
fully exposed in the last undulation. I had observed
the continuation of this great rock crest the previous day
in the basin previous to reaching the Capim Branco
valley. There it crossed the spur on which I was&mdash;"Observation
Spur," I shall call it for purposes of
identification&mdash;almost at right angles. It seemed as
if two forces had been acting simultaneously but in
different directions, and at various points had come
into conflict and eventually had overrun each other.</p>

<p>The last great rocky crest at Capim Branco, when
seen in profile, looked like a huge monolith with a slight
inclination to the south-east. The formation of the
rock itself showed a frothy appearance, such as is
common with any liquefied matter while in a state of
ebullition.</p>

<p>It is quite possible, too, that the great wave of
molten matter travelling from north-east to south-west,
upon encountering some obstacle, had its run interrupted
and had cooled down, while the upper portion
of it, from the impetus received, curled over the summit
of the arrested solidified rock below.</p>

<p>In fact, there was plenty of evidence to show that
while the lower stratum cooled down other sheets of
lava flowed above it, forming many successive layers.
In the eastern part, where they were at an angle of 40&deg;,
these had cracked considerably in cooling. The central
part of the great wave was entirely made up of vertically
fissured strata. The lower half of the mass of rock
showed markedly that it was an anterior wave to the
upper.</p>

<p>There was a wide gap formed by the volcanic crack
between this and the continuation of the undulations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-338" id="Pg_1-338"></a>[<a href="images/1-338.png">338</a>]</span>
to the south-west, which got lower and lower. Perhaps
before the crack occurred that hill was like the others on
the east and west of it, padded with red earth. It must
have become barren by the great shock which caused
the surface of the earth to divide, and which no doubt
shook the surface deposits down. In examining its
north-eastern neighbour it could be seen that it actually
tumbled over when the subsidence occurred, leaving a
gap a few hundred metres wide.</p>

<p>A short distance beyond, on the S.S.E., was an
interesting table-land sloping to the north-east, on the
north side of which could be observed yet one more
beautiful semicircular extinct crater. The rim, or lip
of lava of this crater, had fissured in such a peculiar
way as to give the appearance of a row of rectangular
windows. The sections of the crater which remained
standing showed two conical buttresses above massive
cylindrical bases. From the crater started a huge,
deep crack, 30 to 50 ft. deep and 20 to 100 ft. wide,
which farther down became the actual bed of the
stream. On both sides of this crack was a deep deposit
of red earth and sand, the stratum below this being
a solid mass of lava. The crater on the north-east side
of the mountain had an inclination to the north, but
was quite vertical on the south side.</p>

<p>Beautiful crystals were to be found in abundance
on this mound, as well as great quantities of marble
chips and crystallized rock in various forms.</p>

<p>On the side of this strange mound of rock I found
some curious shallow caves, formed by great fissures
in the rock. The vertical outer walls of these caves
were painted white with lime dissolved in water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-339" id="Pg_1-339"></a>[<a href="images/1-339.png">339</a>]</span>
There were some puzzling carvings, which interested me
greatly. I could not quite make up my mind at first
whether those carvings had been made by Indians or
whether they were the work of escaped negro slaves
who had found shelter in those distant caves. In
character they appeared to me Indian. Negroes, as
a rule, are not much given to rock-carving in order to
record thoughts or events. Moreover, those primitive
carvings showed strong characteristics of hunting people,
such as the Indians were. There were conventional
attempts at designing human figures&mdash;both male and
female&mdash;by mere lines such as a child would draw:
one round dot for the head and one line each for the
body, arms, and legs. Curiously enough&mdash;and this
persuaded me that the drawings had been done by
Indians&mdash;none of the figures possessed more than three
fingers or toes to any extremity. As we have seen,
the Indians cannot count beyond three&mdash;unlike members
of most African tribes, who can all count at least up to
five. This, nevertheless, did not apply to representations
of footmarks, both human and animal&mdash;which
were reproduced with admirable fidelity, I think because
the actual footprints on the rock itself had been
used as a guide before the carving had been made. I
saw the representation of a human footmark, the left,
with five toes, and the shape of the foot correctly drawn.
Evidently the artist or a friend had stood on his right
foot while applying the left to the side of the rock.
When they attempted to draw a human foot on a scale
smaller than nature, they limited themselves to carving
two lines at a wide angle, to form the heel, and five
dots to represent the toes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-340" id="Pg_1-340"></a>[<a href="images/1-340.png">340</a>]</span>
The most wonderful of those rock carvings were
the footprints of the jaguar (<i>on&ccedil;a</i>), reproduced with
such perfection that it seemed almost as if they had
been left there by the animal itself. Not so happy
were the representations of human heads&mdash;one evidently
of an Indian chief, with an aureole of feathers, showing
a painfully distorted vision on the part of the artist.
The eyes were formed by two circles in poor alignment,
the nose by a vertical line, and the mouth, not under
but by the side of the nose, represented by two concentric
curves.</p>

<p>A figure in a sitting posture was interesting enough&mdash;like
a T upside down, with a globe for a head and a
cross-bar for arms. The hands had three fingers each,
but there were only two toes to each foot.</p>

<p>It was interesting to note how the sculptors of those
images caught, in a rudimentary way, the character
of the subjects represented. This was chiefly remarkable
in the footprints of birds and other animals,
such as deer. They seemed particularly fond of representing
deer-horns&mdash;sometimes with double lines at
an angle. That was possibly to commemorate hunting
expeditions. A frequent subject of decoration was a
crude representation of the female organ; and one a
magnified resemblance, angularly drawn, of an Indian
male organ garbed in its typical decoration.</p>

<p class="fsc">Weird Lunar Effect witnessed by Author.</p>
<hr />
<p>The face of the rock was absolutely covered with
drawings, many being mere reproductions of the same
design. Some were so rudimentary that they were
absolutely impossible to identify. One fact was certain,
that those carvings had been made by men who were
trackers by nature and who observed chiefly what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-341" id="Pg_1-341"></a>[<a href="images/1-341.png">341</a>]</span>
they noticed on the ground, instead of around and
above them. Thus, there were no representations
whatever of foliage or trees, no attempts at reproducing
birds, or the sun, the moon, the stars.</p>

<p>The most interesting of all, from an ethnological
point of view, were the geometrical designs. They
closely resembled the incised lines and punch-marks of
the Australian aborigines, and the patterns common
in Polynesia. Concentric circles&mdash;of more or less perfection&mdash;were
common, some with a central cross of
three and four parallel lines. Coils seemed beyond the
drawing powers of Indian artists. Ovals, triangles,
squares, the Egyptian cross (T-shaped), series of detached
circles (these generally enclosed within a triangle,
quadrangle or lozenge) were frequent. Even more
frequent were the parallel incised lines, generally used
as subsidiary filling or shading of other patterns, such
as concentric circles, or sections of triangles or squares.</p>

<p>It may be noted that a certain intelligence was
displayed by the artist in dividing circles fairly accurately
into four and eight sections, the diameters
intersecting pretty well in the centre of the circles.
One pattern which seemed to take their fancy was
that of an oval or a circle with a number of dots inside.</p>

<p>In examining the cave closely, inside and outside,
I also found upon the wall, which was simply covered
with those images, some curious marks resembling the
letters H P, A P, and W <a href="images/ill1-341.jpg"><img src="images/ill1-341_th.jpg" alt="Symbol." title="Symbol." /></a>, which seemed of a more
recent date&mdash;perhaps left there by some missionary
Father or native explorer, or by some escaped slave.</p>

<p>Just below the point where the stream Capim Branco
entered the S. Louren&ccedil;o River (elev. 1,800 ft. above<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-342" id="Pg_1-342"></a>[<a href="images/1-342.png">342</a>]</span>
the sea level), there was a most beautiful waterfall&mdash;the
Salto Floriano Peixoto. Two minor falls, some 30 ft.
high (Salto Benjamin) were also to be seen under arches
of luxuriant vegetation, just above the point of junction
of the two streams.</p>

<p>The roaring and foaming volume of water of the
greater fall rolled over a vertical volcanic rock, about
60 ft. high and 60 ft. wide, with a small terrace half way
up its face. The bed of the river&mdash;below the fall&mdash;was,
like all the torrents of that region, of strangely
shaped lava blocks. With the dense foliage, the innumerable
<i>cait&eacute;</i>, a medicinal plant with huge leaves,
the festooned liane and creepers&mdash;all most verdant in
the sombre green light filtering through the foliage
and the moisture of the abundant spray from the fall&mdash;it
was indeed a magnificent sight. In order to see it,
however, one had to suffer a great deal, because in
forcing one's way through the dense vegetation one got
literally covered with <i>carrapatos</i> and <i>carrapatinhos</i>.</p>

<p>Above the falls, for some hundreds of yards, there
were terrific rapids in the river, which flowed over
a steep bed of yellow lava in terraces, over steps and
over a fourth minor fall some distance off.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-343" id="Pg_1-343"></a>[<a href="images/1-343.png">343</a>]</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">I made</span> up my mind that I would continue my journey
westward no farther, and would now proceed due north
in order to explore the most important part of the
Central Plateau&mdash;the very heart of Brazil&mdash;precisely
where the great Rivers Xingu and Tapajoz had their
birth. I believed that we should there find the highest
point of the Central Brazilian Plateau. I expected to
find in that region the most interesting portion of my
journey&mdash;from the geographical, anthropological, and
geological points of view. I was greatly disappointed
from the anthropological aspect, since I met no one at
all; but from the geological and geographical I was
certainly well repaid for my trouble, great as the trouble
was. We had already ridden to a distance of 1,400 kil.
from the nearest railway.</p>

<hr />
<p>My men mutinied on hearing of my plan, which I
had kept concealed from them. They acted in a most
abject manner. They tried to compel me to return the
way we had come instead of going forward. As I flatly
refused, they claimed their pay and wished to leave
me there and then. Without an instant's hesitation
they were handed their pay up to date and told they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-345" id="Pg_1-345"></a>[<a href="images/1-345.png">345</a>]</span>
could go. The men had not quite realized that they
would have to walk back some 858 kil. to Goyaz,
without food and without animals. Alcides and Filippe
the negro had remained faithful, and on that occasion
stood by my side. Unfortunately, Alcides, who had a
most violent temper, quarrelled with Filippe over some
paltry matter and drove him over to the inimical camp.</p>

<p>So that there I was&mdash;with only one man left. I
am not much given to losing heart over anything.
Alcides showed a strong heart on that occasion. He
and I proceeded for three days to rearrange the baggage
and mend the saddles, etc., in order that we two
alone might take along the entire caravan of animals.
I did not at all look forward to the extra work of
packing all the animals twice a day, and twice a day
unpacking them. The loads weighed about fifty pounds
each, and there were some thirty of them. Then we
should have to hunt for the animals in the morning&mdash;a
job which meant that one had to ride sometimes for
miles to track them and bring them all back to camp.
This prospect, on top of the work I had already in
hand of writing, taking astronomical and meteorological
observations, photography, developing negatives, drawing,
collecting and classifying botanical and geological
specimens, which occupied all day and the greater part
of the night, was a little too much for me. But such
was my joy at having got rid of my unpleasant companions
that I would have put up with any additional
discomfort and inconvenience in order to get on.
Alcides behaved splendidly on that occasion.</p>

<p>June 8th and 9th were absolutely wasted. The
relief from the mental strain of constantly looking after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-346" id="Pg_1-346"></a>[<a href="images/1-346.png">346</a>]</span>&mdash;and
being on my guard against&mdash;my companions was
great. They were days of great happiness to me.</p>

<p>On June 10th Alcides and I were making ready to
depart, with all the animals and baggage, when the
four mutinous followers and Filippe the negro&mdash;most
penitent&mdash;begged to be re-employed. Under ordinary
circumstances I should certainly never have taken
them back; but when one was hundreds of miles from
everywhere, and had no possible way of finding a man,
one had to be patient and make the best of what one
could get. I gave them another chance&mdash;principally in
order to save what I could of my baggage, most of
which I was certain I should have had to abandon had
I proceeded alone with Alcides.</p>

<p>The Capim Branco river was situated between two
undulating ridges of lava.</p>

<p>I steered a course of 300&deg; bearings magnetic (N.W.),
beginning a steep climb at once through the thin
forest of the plateau to the north. In many places
the mules slid and rolled down the precipitous slope
of igneous rock and marble d&eacute;bris, scattering the packs
in every direction. It was a wonder they were not
killed. We urged the animals on, we pushed and pulled
them, we held them with all our might by the bridles
when they began to slide. After many narrow escapes
we reached the summit&mdash;an immense flat stretch of
campos with stunted trees and delicious crisp air&mdash;quite
delightful after the stifling atmosphere of the Capim
Branco basin. The elevation above the sea level was
2,300 ft. On the summit of the plateau was a deep
stratum of red soil. Having marched across the entire
width of the plateau, we found, on descending on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-347" id="Pg_1-347"></a>[<a href="images/1-347.png">347</a>]</span>
opposite side, another series of dome-like mounds of
crimson volcanic rock, with hardly any vegetation
on them&mdash;joined together, and forming many headlands,
as it were. Beyond an empty space&mdash;an opening
in the landscape&mdash;a great barrier crossed the range of
domes almost at right angles.</p>

<p>We descended through thick undergrowth, under
big <i>jatoba do matto</i> (<i>Hymenc&aelig;a Courbaril</i> L.) trees. The
<i>jatoba</i> or <i>jatahy</i> wood has a high specific gravity, and
is considered one of the woods with the highest resistance
to disintegration in Brazil&mdash;as high as 1 kg.
315 gr. per square centimetre.</p>

<p>At 2,050 ft. we found a streamlet flowing southward.
We were then in a grassy basin&mdash;another
<i>cuvette</i> with two central tufts of thickly packed trees.
We were lucky enough to see some <i>coco babento</i> palms,
from which we shook down dates which were excellent,
although somewhat troublesome to eat, owing to the
innumerable filaments protecting the central large stone.
These filaments stuck between one's teeth, and were
most difficult to remove. The dates were the size and
shape of an ordinary English walnut and extremely oily.</p>

<p>It was a real joy to see fine healthy trees again, after
the miserable specimens we had seen of late. Even
there, too, the powerful trees which emerged from the
lower entangled scrub and dense foliage were greatly
contorted, as if they had gone through a terrific effort
in order to push their way through to reach the light
and air. Liane innumerable and of all sizes hung
straight or festooned from the highest trees or coiled
in a deadly embrace round their branches like snakes.
Nor were they the only enemies of trees. Large<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-348" id="Pg_1-348"></a>[<a href="images/1-348.png">348</a>]</span>
swellings could be noticed around most of the trees,
caused by the terrible <i>cupim</i> (<i>termes album</i>) or white
ants, carrying out their destructive work just under
the bark. Many indeed were the trees absolutely
killed by those industrious little devils.</p>

<p>As we marched through the <i>matto</i>, using the large
knives freely to open our way, we had to make great
deviations in our course&mdash;now because of a giant
<i>jatoba</i> lying dead upon the ground, then to give a wide
berth to a group of graceful <i>akuri</i> palms, with their
huge spiky leaves. Those palms had great bunches of
fruit. We were beginning now to find trees with fan-like
extensions at the roots and base, such as I had
frequently met with in the forests of Mindanao Island
(Philippine Archipelago), where they were called
<i>caripapa</i> and <i>nonoko</i> trees. The <i>vines</i> or <i>liane</i> were
getting interesting, some being of great length and of
colossal size, twisted round like a ship's cable.</p>

<p>We rose again to an elevation of 2,600 ft. On emerging
from the cool dark forest and its refreshing green
light, we found ourselves on another plateau with a
slightly arched summit, of beautiful campos. From
that height we looked over the immense undulating
plain to the south. To the south-east we gazed upon
a lower flat-topped plateau bounding the valley which,
in great sweeping undulations from south-east to
north-west, resembled an ocean with waves of colossal
magnitude. We travelled across the slightly domed
grassy plateau, and found on it a <i>cuvette</i>&mdash;only slightly
depressed this time, but with the usual central
line of tall trees with luxuriant foliage, <i>burity</i> palms
and <i>pintahyba</i> trees. There, too, we had a surface<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-349" id="Pg_1-349"></a>[<a href="images/1-349.png">349</a>]</span>
stratum of red earth and fine brown dust, with an under
stratum of grey ashes. Soon after we came to a second
<i>cuvette</i>, and farther north a third could be perceived.
In fact, the summit of that particular table-land was
made up of subsidiary domes dividing <i>cuvette</i> from
<i>cuvette</i> in succession.</p>

<p>In going down to 2,550 ft. we found a streamlet
flowing northwest into the Rio das Mortes&mdash;or "River
of Death." We were there on the great divide between
the waters flowing south into the S. Louren&ccedil;o and eventually
into the Paran&aacute;, and those flowing north&mdash;after
thousands of kilometres&mdash;into the Amazon. This little
rivulet was therefore interesting to me, for it was the
first one I had met flowing north since leaving the
Araguaya&mdash;although not the first whose waters eventually
flowed in a circuitous way into the Amazon.</p>

<p>That was a day of great domes&mdash;all of them with
perfect curves. On them the grazing was magnificent.
To the north a wonderful green dome, larger than the
others (elev. 2,650 ft.), would have been splendid for
cattle raising. Not a sign of life could be seen anywhere.
Seldom have I seen nature so still and devoid
of animal life. What immensity of rich land wasted!
It made one's heart bleed to see it. There was everything
there to make the fortunes of a hundred thousand
farmers&mdash;yet there was not a soul! There was
good grazing, plenty of water. There were no roads,
no trails, it is true, but with a little enterprise it
would be easy to make them. With a railway passing
through, that now wasted land should become the
richest on earth.</p>

<p>In a depression (elev. 2,450 ft.) we came to a stream<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-350" id="Pg_1-350"></a>[<a href="images/1-350.png">350</a>]</span>let
also flowing north, which had made the soil extremely
swampy. We had endless trouble in getting across,
the animals sinking and sticking in the black mud up
to their necks. One of the mules&mdash;more reckless than
the others&mdash;actually disappeared, baggage and all, while
madly struggling to extricate itself from the sucking
slush and mud. It took all our efforts combined to
save that animal. By the time we had all got across,
men, animals, and baggage were a sight worth looking
at&mdash;all filthy, absolutely smothered in black mud.</p>

<p>We rose upon yet another dome, and then descended
to the Rio Manso or Rio das Mortes, the head-waters
of which were not far from there, to the south-west,
in the Serra da Chapada. The river was there only
15 metres wide, but too deep and rapid for the animals
to ford, so we had to follow its bank in order to find a
suitable spot. The River das Mortes flowed, roughly,
first in an easterly then in a north-easterly direction,
and soon, swollen by innumerable streams, became the
most powerful tributary of the Araguaya River, which
it met almost opposite the centre of the great island of
Bananal. In fact, one might almost consider the
head-waters of the Rio das Mortes as the secondary
sources of the great Araguaya. The Rio das Mortes
flowed, at the particular spot where we met it, due
north, along the edge of the great dome. The elevation
of the top edge was 2,470 ft.</p>

<p>We camped that night on the Riber&atilde;o do Boi, a
swift torrent tributary of the Rio das Mortes (elev.
2,250 ft.), having marched 30 kil. that day. The cold
was relatively severe during the night&mdash;the thermometer
registering a minimum of 48&deg; Fahr.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-351" id="Pg_1-351"></a>[<a href="images/1-351.png">351</a>]</span>
We were travelling entirely by prismatic compass.
My men&mdash;who had no faith whatever in what they
called the <i>agulha</i> (compass)&mdash;swore that we were going
to sure perdition.</p>

<p>"How can that <i>agulha</i>," said they, "possibly tell
you where we can find beans (<i>feij&atilde;o</i>), lard (<i>toucinho</i>), and
sugar bricks (<i>rapadura</i>)?" "It is the invention of
some madman!" said one. "It will bring us to our
death," sadly reflected another. "If I had only known
that we should be entrusting our lives all the time to
that <i>agulha</i>," murmured a third, pointing contemptuously
to the compass, "I should have never come.
Oh, my poor mother and wife! And my dear little
daughter six months old! Oh, shall I ever see them
again ... shall I ever see them again?" Here followed
a stream of bitter tears, wiped with the ragged sleeve
of his shirt.</p>

<p>I thought that a cold bath would do them all good.
I ordered them to take all the animals and baggage
across the stream. It was a job of some difficulty,
owing to the very swift current. A rough bridge had
to be constructed over the most dangerous part. The
water was freezingly cold.</p>

<p>On leaving the river we at once rose again over
another great dome (elev. 2,350 ft.), from which we
obtained a most glorious view of other grassy domes,
smooth-looking and well-rounded, with a fringe of
forest in the depressions between. Down below we
could see the Rio das Mortes we had left behind. It
came at that spot from the south-east, and after describing
an angle turned to the north-east. From the
north-west, at an elevation of 2,300 ft., descended the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-352" id="Pg_1-352"></a>[<a href="images/1-352.png">352</a>]</span>
Taperinho, a small tributary which entered the Rio
das Mortes.</p>

<p>We went over another domed mount, where
I found a spring of most delicious water emerging
in a gurgle from the very summit of the dome,
at an elevation of 2,400 ft. On all sides we had
beautiful domed prominences with wonderful grazing
land.</p>

<p>Alcides&mdash;careless, like all the others, with his rifle&mdash;was
nearly killed that day. His rifle went off accidentally,
and the bullet went right through the brim
of his hat, just grazing his forehead. But we were
accustomed to this sort of thing&mdash;it had happened so
often&mdash;and I began to wonder when bullets would
really wound or kill somebody. Indeed, we had a
guardian angel over us.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill1-352.jpg"><img src="images/ill1-352_th.jpg" alt="A Picturesque Waterfall on the S. Louren&ccedil;o River." title="A Picturesque Waterfall on the S. Louren&ccedil;o River." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">A Picturesque Waterfall on the S. Louren&ccedil;o River.</p>
<hr />
<p>We had descended into the belt of forest in the
depression (elev. 2,270 ft.), where a streamlet flowed
to the north-east into the Rio das Mortes. We were
travelling in a north-easterly direction, owing to the
formation of the country; but finding that it would
take me too much away from my intended course I
again altered our direction to a course due north. At
an elevation of 2,480 ft. we went over an extraordinary
natural bridge of solidified ashes and earth&mdash;a regular
tunnel&mdash;under which passed a streamlet of delicious
water&mdash;the Pulad&oacute; Stream. The river emerged some
distance off from under the tunnel. Curiously enough,
while the vegetation was quite dense both above and
below the natural bridge, there was no vegetation at
all along the hundred metres forming the width of the
bridge. Perhaps that was due to the lack of evapora<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-353" id="Pg_1-353"></a>[<a href="images/1-353.png">353</a>]</span>tion
in that section, which supplied the trees elsewhere
with moisture.</p>

<p>We rode over many domes of an elevation of 2,550 ft.,
and then over some that were smaller in diameter
but of greater height. In the depressions between
we invariably found rows of <i>burity</i> palms amidst other
vegetation, and the characteristic heavily foliaged trees.</p>

<p>We encamped near a delicious spring of water on
the very summit of a dome. The water emerged from
a circular hole and was warm&mdash;so much so that the next
morning, when my Fahrenheit thermometer registered
an atmospheric temperature of 50&deg;, steam rose from
the water of the spring. Around the spring a curious
conical mound of white finely powdered matter resembling
kaolin had formed. This appeared to me to
have formerly been a small geyser. The cone was
broken on one side and the water did not come out
with great force. A few yards down the slope of the
dome another similar white cone was to be seen, with
a great mass of granular ash-pellets and tufa, such as
are commonly found near geysers or thermal springs.
We called that camp Cayambola.</p>

<p>On the night of June 12th the minimum temperature
was 50&deg; Fahr., the elevation 2,430 ft. The sky was
somewhat clouded, the clouds occupying four-tenths of
the heavens. At sunrise we observed radiations in the
sky&mdash;this time, curiously enough, from north-east to
south-west, instead of from east to west. The longest
and highest semicircle above us was in double filaments,
and resembled an immense fish-bone.</p>

<p>We were supposed to be then in a country infested
by cannibal Indians&mdash;swarms of them. My men were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-354" id="Pg_1-354"></a>[<a href="images/1-354.png">354</a>]</span>
quite amusing in their fears. Four of them were
troublesome and insisted on the whole expedition
turning back in order to see them safely out of danger.
I remembered on those occasions an old Italian proverb
which said that to "women, lunatics, and children"
the wisest thing is always to say "Yes."</p>

<p>So when they threatened all kinds of things if we
did not return I generally answered that we would
continue a little farther, then we would see; and from
day to day this went on, making forced marches forward
all the time&mdash;generally of from 30 to 42 kil. daily. The
dissatisfaction among my men grew, nevertheless,
considerable, and a constant watch had to be kept over
them. Alcides and Filippe the negro showed great
courage, and, whatever other failings they may have
had, they invariably displayed extraordinary bravery
from beginning to end.</p>

<p>Alcides' principal faults were his great wastefulness
and violent temper and pride, which made it most
difficult to deal with him. He had been entrusted with
the commissariat, as with all my other occupations I
could not be bothered to sort out and weigh the food
for each man at each meal. Alcides would not understand
that it was unwise, in a country where absolutely
nothing was procurable, to throw away daily little
mountains of rice and beans and preserved meat, after
the men and our dogs had gorged themselves; and
that perhaps it would lead some day to our dying of
starvation. In confidence I had told him that we might
be several months&mdash;perhaps a year&mdash;before we should
be able to get fresh supplies. A little economy would
perhaps save us all from disaster. I wanted everybody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-355" id="Pg_1-355"></a>[<a href="images/1-355.png">355</a>]</span>
to have ample food, but I did not see the use of throwing
away daily a larger quantity than the men actually
ate. It was true that we still had ample provisions of
all kinds for some eight months, but we must be prepared
for all emergencies.</p>

<p>Alcides, who was extremely obstinate, would not
hear of this. My remarks only made things worse.
The waste from that day doubled, and looking ahead
into the future it really broke my heart, as I well saw
that we should have hard times in front of us&mdash;all
because of the lack of common-sense on the part of my
followers.</p>

<p>On leaving camp we climbed to the summit of
another gigantic dome of green pasture land (elev.
2,500 ft.). We filled our lungs with the delicious air, slightly
stirred by a fresh northerly breeze. Geographically,
we were at a most important site, for it was from that
point that the division of waters took place between
those flowing eastward into the Araguaya and those
flowing westward into the Cuyab&aacute; River. So that
within a distance of a few kilometres we had visited
the region&mdash;the very heart of Brazil&mdash;from which the
waters parted to flow toward three different points of
the compass.</p>

<p>From that point we rose still higher to the summit
of a great table-land, absolutely flat and waterless for
over 30 kil. The soil was red in colour, with slippery
dried grass upon it and sparse, stunted vegetation.
The trees seldom reached a height of 5 ft. They were
mostly <i>gomarabia</i> or <i>goma arabica</i>&mdash;a sickly-looking
acacia; <i>passanto</i> with its huge leaves, <i>piqui</i> or <i>pequia</i>
(<i>Aspidosperma sessiliflorum</i> and <i>eburneum</i> Fr. All.), the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-356" id="Pg_1-356"></a>[<a href="images/1-356.png">356</a>]</span>
fibrous <i>piteira</i> or <i>poteira</i> (<i>Fourcroya gigantea</i> Vent.),
and short <i>tocun</i> or <i>tucum</i> palms (<i>Astrocaryum tucuma</i>
M.). Occasionally one saw a <i>passanto</i> tree slightly
taller&mdash;perhaps some 10 to 12 ft. high&mdash;most an&aelig;mic-looking.</p>

<p>After having travelled some 24 kil. from our last
camp we came to a great expanse of <i>taquary</i>, a kind
of shrub 3 ft. high with spiky leaves of a wonderful
green colour.</p>

<p>We gazed upon the superb view of an enormous
plateau to the west with deep indentations in its
vertical sides. Huge spurs or rams of rock stretched
out across the deep depression, separating the plateau
to the west from the one on which we were standing.
Both plateaux were of equal height, and had evidently
at one time formed one immense flat surface. On our
side the plateau showed a huge slip of red volcanic
earth, with a lower stratum parallel to it of baked
brown rock. Under it were white lime and ashes, in
sections or drifts. In the centre of the valley formed
by the separation of the two sections there remained
a formidable crater&mdash;extinct, of course&mdash;with an arc-shaped
wall standing erect in its centre, and other
lower walls forming an elongated quadrangular channel
from south-east to north-west in the bottom of the
crater. Two conspicuous monoliths stood up behind
the huge lip of the crater to the south-west at the
bottom of the valley, and also other remnants of the
great convulsion of nature which had once taken place
there.</p>

<p class="fsc">A Ca&ntilde;on of Matto Grosso.</p>
<hr />
<p>Notwithstanding the constant annoyance of my
followers, I really enjoyed my journey over the central<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-357" id="Pg_1-357"></a>[<a href="images/1-357.png">357</a>]</span>
plateau. The air was fresh and deliciously crisp and
clear. One could see for miles and miles and distinguish
the smallest detail in the far-away mountain sides, so
pure was the atmosphere. This scene was unlike any
in other countries. One could describe an entire circle
around oneself, and nowhere did the eye meet a column
of smoke rising above ground to indicate the presence
of man. Not a bird was to be seen or heard, not a
footprint upon the ground of any beast or creature of
any kind. The silence of that land was most impressive.
Our voices&mdash;as we spoke&mdash;sounded astonishingly and
abnormally sonorous, in that region which for thousands
of years had not been contaminated by sound. It
seemed as if the sound-waves, undisturbed by the
myriads of sounds which&mdash;as is well known&mdash;remain
floating in the atmosphere in inhabited countries, were
heard there in all their full and absolute purity. So
much were we all impressed by this fact&mdash;my men
unconsciously&mdash;that all the men began to sing, so
pleased they seemed with the powerful vibration of
their own voices.</p>

<p>To the north-west another lovely sight was before
us&mdash;another huge plateau in dim greyish blue&mdash;barring
the horizon. In front of it was one more table-land,
more broken up, and sloping on the south side.</p>

<p>When we reached the north-east edge of the plateau
we were travelling upon, we were treated to a fresh
marvellous scene. Straight in front of us, on the
opposite side of a deep depression&mdash;at 30&deg; bearings
magnetic&mdash;there stood one of the characteristic two-tiered
table-lands stretching from east to west. Below
us in the depression was an undulating line from north<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-358" id="Pg_1-358"></a>[<a href="images/1-358.png">358</a>]</span>
to south of great bosses or domes of exquisite grassy
land, resting upon a kind of spur or peninsula jutting
out from our plateau&mdash;but at a lower elevation&mdash;of
which it formed part.</p>

<p>A formidable crack in the earth's surface extended
from north to south on the east of the chain of domes,
whereas to the east again of the giant crack was another
row of domed hills, forming&mdash;when taken as a mass&mdash;an
undulating terrace; then a vertical wall, above
which rested the sloping side of the plateau on which
we stood. It may be observed that the strata in the
split vertical wall on our side was absolutely horizontal.
On the summit of this rocky stratum lay a deposit,
30 ft. thick, composed of red earth and sand over yellow
sandstone and ashes, and, lower, grey ashes compressed
and consolidated. The lowest stratum visible
on the face of the wall was of bright red-baked rock.</p>

<p>The great depression, taken in its entirety, extended
from south-east to north-west. The huge crater was
to the south-east. To the south-west there was an
immense basin.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> had reached the end of the comparatively flat
plateau, which varied in elevation on its summit from
2,530 ft. to 2,570 ft. above the sea level. We were
next faced by a most precipitous descent in order
to go down to the Jangada River&mdash;which eventually
flowed into the distant Rio Cuyaba. There was, of
course, no trail of any kind, and the course of the
descent before us was not unlike trying to take our
animals down the almost vertical wall of a fortress.
With picks and spades we cut a narrow path for a
short distance in order to start the reluctant beasts
down. I recommended the greatest care to my men,
but instead of following my instructions they drove the
rebellious quadrupeds with their whips in a heap along
the path&mdash;only a few inches wide&mdash;which we had cut.
Result: Collisions among the animals and against the
wall, and, next, five mules and baggage rolled down
the mountain-side at a vertiginous speed until they had
reached the bottom, some hundreds of feet below.
Antonio, the strong man of the party, who tried to go
to the rescue of one of the animals, was also dragged
down, and came within an ace of losing his life. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-360" id="Pg_1-360"></a>[<a href="images/1-360.png">360</a>]</span>
was able to embrace a shrub with all his might just
before rolling over the precipice, and we rescued him.
We had to waste a great deal of time cutting an improvised
way in the mountain side. Then we had to
unload all the animals and convey the loads down on
men's heads. Each animal was then with great difficulty
and danger led by hand down to the stream.</p>

<p>Great quantities of beautiful marble and crystals
were met with, and masses of lava pellets and ferruginous
rock. In the Jangada valley we found two hot springs
emerging from the side of the plateau from which we
had descended. I discovered there two miserable tiny
sheds belonging to a family of escaped negro slaves.
They had lived seventeen years in that secluded spot.
They grew enough Indian corn to support them. All
the members of the family were pitifully deformed and
demented. Seldom have I seen such miserable-looking
specimens of humanity. One was demented to such
an extent that it was impossible to get out of him more
than a few disconnected groans. He spent most of
his time crouched like an animal, and hardly seemed
conscious of what took place round him. Another was
a deaf and dumb <i>cr&eacute;tin</i>; a third possessed a monstrous
hare-lip and a deformed jaw; while two women, dried
up and skinny, and a child were badly affected by
go&iuml;tre. For a single family that seemed a melancholy
spectacle.</p>

<p class="fsc">How Author's Animals rolled down Trailless Ravines.</p>
<hr />
<p>It was really pitiable&mdash;everywhere in the interior
of Brazil&mdash;wherever you came across a family, to find
that all its members were <i>cr&eacute;tins</i>, and deformed to such
an extent as to make them absolutely repulsive. Frequently
I had noticed among the common abnormalities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-361" id="Pg_1-361"></a>[<a href="images/1-361.png">361</a>]</span>
supernumerary fingers and toes. One child at this
place, in fact, had six toes to each foot, besides being
an idiot, deaf and dumb, and affected by go&iuml;tre. The
only one of the family who was able to realize what took
place was terrified at our approach, and never got over
his terror as long as we remained. He suffered from
the illusion that everybody wished to murder him.
For some reason or other he believed that I had come
specially, all the way from my own country, in order
to search for him and kill him. All the most considerate
words on my part, the showering of presents,
had no effect upon him. He sat some way off, watching
me attentively all the time, and whenever I moved my
hands in any direction he dashed away shrieking,
thinking that I should attempt to strangle him&mdash;for
his mania was death by strangulation. After a while
he returned, and in his broken, almost unintelligible
language&mdash;his tongue was nearly paralyzed and he
had difficulty in articulating properly&mdash;begged to be
spared.</p>

<p>Those people lived worse than animals&mdash;in an
appallingly filthy condition, in two miserable, tumble-down
sheds, open on all sides, and not more than 8 ft.
high. They were reduced to that condition by intermarriage
among themselves; brothers with sisters&mdash;a
most frequent occurrence among the "civilized" of
Central Brazil&mdash;and even fathers with daughters and
sons with their mothers: a disgusting state of affairs
which could not very well be helped in a race and in a
climate where the animal qualities were extraordinarily
developed while the mental were almost entirely
deficient. Worse still, I had several cases under ob<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-362" id="Pg_1-362"></a>[<a href="images/1-362.png">362</a>]</span>servation
in which the animal passions had not been
limited to closely related human beings, but extended
also to animals, principally dogs. The degeneration
of those people was indeed beyond all conception. It
was caused, first of all, by the effects of the most terrible
corruption of their blood, their subsequent impoverishment
of blood through intermarriage, the miserable
isolated existence which they led on scarce and bad food,
the exposure to all kinds of weather, and the absolute
lack of thought&mdash;almost paralyzing the brain power.
It was heart-rending to think that human beings could
possibly degenerate to so low a level, and&mdash;what was
worse&mdash;that beings of that kind were extraordinarily
prolific; so that, instead of being exterminated&mdash;which
would be a mercy for the country&mdash;they were in a
small way on the increase.</p>

<p>I camped near the sheds of that "happy family,"
having gone 42 kil. from the Rio das Mortes. I felt
sad the whole night, watching them unperceived. It
upset me so that I was ill for several days.</p>

<p>The Rio Jangada, at an altitude of 1,550 ft., was
1,000 ft. lower than the top of the plateau. The river
flowed west into the Cuyab&aacute; River. We crossed the
stream, a rapid and foaming torrent. We soon began to
climb again on the opposite side over sweeping undulations.
We waded through two more streamlets flowing
west&mdash;the second at an elevation of 1,650 ft. We were
travelling partly among campos on the summit of cones
and domes, partly through brush or scrub in the depressions.
We struggled on, urging the tired animals,
rising gradually to 2,150 ft., then to 2,200 ft., over soil
strewn with volcanic pebbles and scori&aelig;. During the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-363" id="Pg_1-363"></a>[<a href="images/1-363.png">363</a>]</span>
night the minimum temperature had been 53&deg; Fahr.,
but during the day the sun was extremely hot and
powerful, and animals and men were sweating freely.
We marched northward, then slightly to the north-west,
leaving behind, to the south-west of us, two quadrangular
table-lands, rising above the undulating line of a
depression.</p>

<p>Shortly after, to the E.N.E., we perceived the
section of an extinct crater&mdash;the easterly point of its
summit being in itself a semicircular subsidiary crater.
On one side of the greater crater was a conical depression,
at the bottom of which (elev. 2,400 ft.) was
an extensive bed of lava blocks of great size&mdash;hundreds
of monolithic rocks standing up like pillars. In fact,
they stood all along the side of the crater as well as
inside it. Surrounding a pyramidal hill a group of
those huge pillars looked&mdash;to a casual observer&mdash;just
like the ruins of a tumble-down abbey.</p>

<p>Three hours' journey from our camp we reached the
summit of a dome (elev. 2,500 ft.). Beyond it was a
<i>cuvette</i> with its typical central line of <i>burity</i> palms.</p>

<p>To the west we perceived a marvellous view of three
immense dykes of red rock&mdash;like walls&mdash;stretching from
south-west to north-east; then two more great perpendicular
dykes of granite were disclosed close by.</p>

<p>Going over domes 2,550 ft. and 2,450 ft. above the
sea level, we obtained a vast and immense view of the
<i>serrad&atilde;o</i>&mdash;wild country&mdash;before us, a regular ocean of
deep green undulations rising quite high to the south;
whereas to the north there extended a long plateau with
a deep ravine on its southern aspect.</p>

<p>We descended through scrub (elev. 2,400 ft.)&mdash;what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-364" id="Pg_1-364"></a>[<a href="images/1-364.png">364</a>]</span>
the Brazilians call <i>serrad&atilde;o</i>&mdash;and through a growth of
stunted trees (elev. 2,450 ft.) to so low an altitude as
2,300 ft. Going along a rocky cliff, we passed a strange
volcanic vent-hole with a pyramid of granite of large
proportions on each side of its aperture.</p>

<p>We arrived at the Roncador, a picturesque torrent
flowing over a bed of lava moulded in the strangest
possible shapes, hollows, terraces and grottoes. Most
peculiar were the great concave hollows, circular, oval,
and of irregular form, which were innumerable and of
all sizes along that extensive flow of lava.</p>

<p class="fsc">Hideous Types characteristic of Central Brazil.</p>
<p class="figcenter">Two women (left) and two men (right).</p>
<hr />
<p>We had travelled 30 kil. that day. That was such
a picturesque spot that I made camp on the right
bank of the torrent. We were all amazed to find an
immense block of rock&mdash;resembling in size and form
the Sphinx of Egypt&mdash;balanced to a nicety over the
edge of a conical rocky hill. It was, of course, the
work of nature. Why that rock remained there at all
and did not tumble down, was more than we could
understand. There was also a giant monolith and
other strange-looking rocks of great size standing up at
all angles close by. On climbing the hill where the
Sphinx-like rock stood, I discovered a circular crater
of great beauty, 300 metres in diameter. The western
wall of the crater had been knocked down, but on the
eastern inner side, in the central part 150 ft. high, there
was a precipitous fall, then a huge smooth inclined
plane of lava at an angle of 15&deg; overlapping the top,
where it had subsequently been subjected either to
violent earthquake shocks or other disturbing influences,
as it was badly seamed and fissured. Many
segments had crumbled down, leaving the remaining<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-365" id="Pg_1-365"></a>[<a href="images/1-365.png">365</a>]</span>
portion of a most extraordinary shape. In the centre
of the crater there stood a huge mass of rock 150 ft.
high, which looked like an inclined table&mdash;a giant slab
cleanly cut at its angles, which protruded at great
length outside the base formed by broken-up blocks.
On looking west from the summit of the extinct volcano
one obtained a marvellous view of the vertical cliffs
between which the Roncador River flowed.</p>

<p>Then there was a great table-land extending from
north to south, composed of red volcanic rock and white
limestone. A separate red quadrangular castle-like
structure of immense proportions rose in the middle
foreground in the north-west upon a conical green grassy
base.</p>

<p>Add to this wonderful work of Nature a magnificent
sky of gold and brilliant vermilion, as limpid as limpid
could be, and you will perhaps imagine why I could not
move from the rock on which I sat gazing at that
magnificent, almost awe-inspiring, spectacle. Night
came on swiftly, as it always does in those latitudes,
and I scrambled down the hill, among the sharp, cutting,
slippery, shiny rocks, arriving in camp minus a good
many patches of skin upon my shins and knuckles.</p>

<p>At the point where I crossed the Roncador River
there were three handsome waterfalls in succession,
the central one in two terraces, some 90 ft. high. At
the foot of the two-tiered waterfall was a great circular
basin which had all the appearance of having been
formerly a volcanic vent. The flowing water, which
tumbled down with terrific force, had further washed
its periphery smooth. The centre of the basin was of
immense depth. Directly under the fall a spacious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-366" id="Pg_1-366"></a>[<a href="images/1-366.png">366</a>]</span>
grotto was to be seen under a huge projecting
rock.</p>

<p>The elevation of the stream above the falls was
2,150 ft., below the falls 2,060 ft. The temperature of
the atmosphere was 72&deg; Fahr., and the minimum temperature
during the night 58&deg; Fahr.</p>

<p>The Roncador flowed from north-east to south-west
as far as the foot of the great plateau we had observed
during our march. There, on meeting the great
vertical wall, its course was diverted in a northerly
direction and then again to the north-west, where the
stream eventually fell into the Cuyab&aacute; River. The
Rio Jangada, on which we had camped the previous
day, was a tributary of the Roncador, and so was the
streamlet called Pedra Grande, which entered the
Roncador on its right side. The Pedra Grande took
its name from an immense monolith, worn quite smooth,
near its bank.</p>

<p>From the Roncador we continued on our northerly
course. The western view of the "balanced Sphinx
boulder" was indeed remarkable. It seemed to stand
up on a small pivot despite all the laws of gravitation,
the heaviest side of the upper rock projecting far out
on one side with nothing to balance it on the other.</p>

<p>Cutting our way easily in the scrub, we rose to
2,300 ft. over a flow of red lava (it had flowed in an
easterly direction) in several successive strata. The
upper stratum was grooved into geometrical patterns,
such as we had met before, wherever it showed through
the thin layer of red volcanic sand which covered most
of it. We were there in a zone of immense natural
pillars of rock, some of such great height that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-367" id="Pg_1-367"></a>[<a href="images/1-367.png">367</a>]</span>
were visible miles off along the range&mdash;which extended
from south to north, parallel, in fact, to the course
we were following.</p>

<p>Still proceeding due north, we arrived on the summit
of a great dome, 2,500 ft., from which point we had to
alter our course to the north-west, owing to an isolated
impassable barrier which we left on our right (north).
It had steep slopes but well-rounded terminal points.
It extended from N.N.E. to S.S.W., and had a height
of some 150 ft. above the flat <i>serrad&atilde;o</i>, on which my
skeleton-like mules wended their way among the
stunted trees, the bells dangling from their necks
monotonously tinkling&mdash;not the gay, brisk tinkling of
animals full of life, as when we had left Goyaz, but the
weak, mournful sound&mdash;ding ... ding ... ding&mdash;of
tired, worn-out beasts, stumbling along anyhow. Occasionally
one heard the crashing of broken branches
or of trees collapsing at the collision with the packs,
or the violent braying of the animals when stung in
sensitive parts by an extra-violent fly; otherwise there
was silence, the silence of death, all round us.</p>

<p>The poor brutes tore mouthfuls of grass, now on
one side then on the other, as they went along; but
the grazing was poor in the <i>serrad&atilde;o</i>, and the animals
found only enough to subsist upon. Two of them were
absolutely disabled, owing to accidents we had had;
and, with the animals I had lost, this involved loading
extra heavily those still able to carry. The
constant collisions against the stunted trees in that
trail-less region injured the animals considerably and
caused nasty sores and swellings all over their bodies.
I saw well that the poor beasts would not last much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-368" id="Pg_1-368"></a>[<a href="images/1-368.png">368</a>]</span>
longer. It was impossible to halt a sufficient time to
let them recover in that particular region, with food
so scarce&mdash;it would have taken them months. In the
meantime our provisions were being fast consumed&mdash;or
rather wasted&mdash;and we had thousands of kilometres
to go yet. My men never suspected this, or they would
have never come on; but I knew only too well.</p>

<p>They still insisted on marching with their loaded
rifles, fully cocked, resting horizontally upon their
shoulders; and as we marched naturally in single file,
and as we used cordite cartridges with bullets of high
penetration, there was still a prospect of a bullet going
through one or more of us. Once or twice again a
rifle went off unexpectedly by accident. It would have
been terrible for any one of a nervous temperament
to be travelling with such companions. On previous
expeditions I had generally trusted in myself, but on
this particular one I was so disgusted that I had made
up my mind to trust in Providence alone. I did well,
for had I done otherwise I might have fared much worse
than I did.</p>

<p>We went over a pass (elev. 2,400 ft.) between two
small domes, quite barren but for a scanty growth of
short dried grass. We were marching over masses of
lava and conglomerate with innumerable marble pellets.
We found ourselves within a regular circle of low hills
enclosing a shallow depression. Subsequently we came
to a second and then to a third similar depression.</p>

<p class="fsc">The Roncador River.</p>
<hr />
<p>Continuing in a north-westerly direction we again
obtained a gorgeous view of the treble <i>portal</i>&mdash;by which
word the Brazilians describe a monumental entrance of
any kind. That is just what those three immense gaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-369" id="Pg_1-369"></a>[<a href="images/1-369.png">369</a>]</span>
in the plateau looked like: an immense wall of rock
forming a high barrier, with three gigantic natural
gateways.</p>

<p>After finding a stream of good water on the west
side of the plateau we rose again higher, obtaining a
splendid bird's-eye view of the picturesque depression
we had just crossed. The effects of erosion following
those of volcanic activity were evident enough upon
the entire landscape. On the west side we had a horseshoe-shaped
vertical wall&mdash;seemingly containing an
extinct crater&mdash;and yet another on the north side of
the western end of the elongated ellipse which was
there formed.</p>

<p>With some difficulty we managed to get the animals
up to the summit of the plateau (elev. 2,580 ft.). From
there we obtained a sumptuous view beyond. An
immense dyke of brilliant red rock, flat-topped, lay
majestically to the west. At its foot the Rio Pedra
Grande had its birth, and then flowed westward into
the Rio Roncador. Four gigantic flat table-lands stood
impressively in a line. Three more, equally impressive,
loomed in the south-west. Other minor ones, quite
wall-like&mdash;rectangular in vertical section&mdash;appeared in
the blue distance, while the horizon was barred by a
long flat plateau.</p>

<p>Looking north as we descended from the table-land,
we found on our left another extinct crater&mdash;semicircular
in shape, with several superimposed strata of
lava, each about one foot thick, capping its lip, which
was broken up into three sections. The valley below
that crater formed a <i>cuvette</i>, the bottom of which (elev.
2,200 ft.) showed deep erosion by water in one or two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-370" id="Pg_1-370"></a>[<a href="images/1-370.png">370</a>]</span>
places. Sand covered the lava-flow which had travelled
northward. Quantities of heavy, spherical, bullet-like
blocks of hard-baked rock were scattered all about&mdash;evidently
shot out of the crater when active.</p>

<p>We had travelled 80 kil. from Cayambola in three
days, and we had reached a spot of slight, well-rounded
undulations where grazing was fair. I decided to halt
early in the afternoon&mdash;more particularly as this spot
appeared to me to have been at one time or other submerged&mdash;probably
it had been a lake bottom. I had,
since the beginning of my journey, been searching everywhere
for fossils&mdash;but in vain. I had not seen the
vestiges of a single one. Personally, I was persuaded
that Central Brazil could well be geologically classified
in the archaic group&mdash;the most ancient of the terrestrial
crust, and consisting (in Brazil) chiefly of gneiss, mica
schists and granite, solidified into their present form
by intense eruptive phenomena and dissolved&mdash;not by
immersion in ocean waters, as some suppose, but by
deluges of such potentiality as the human mind can
hardly conceive.</p>

<p>It was quite enough to visit the central plateau of
Brazil to be persuaded that that continent had never
been submerged under a sea; on the contrary, it must
have been the oven of the world. The volcanic activity
which must have taken place in that part of the world&mdash;it
was not a separate continent in those days&mdash;was
quite, as I have said, beyond human conception. This
does not mean that at later periods there may not have
been temporary lakes&mdash;as, for instance, in the spot
where we encamped that night&mdash;or portions of country
which had become flooded, upon the cooling of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-371" id="Pg_1-371"></a>[<a href="images/1-371.png">371</a>]</span>
earth, and subsequently became drained and dry
again.</p>

<p>A wonderful surprise awaited me that day. To the
north of my camp was a peculiar round mound. I
climbed it, and what was my astonishment in the short
ascent to find near the summit, among a lot of lava
pellets, marble fragments, crystals, and great lumps
of iron ore, a number of vertebr&aelig; from the tail and
spine of a giant reptile! The vertebr&aelig; had been disjointed
and scattered somewhat about by wind and
water&mdash;but there they were; the smaller ones on the
side of the hill, the larger on the summit&mdash;which led
me to believe that the animal had crouched on the top
of the hill when dying. Some of the fossil vertebr&aelig;
were so large and heavy that I hardly had the strength
to lift them up. The bones&mdash;petrified&mdash;were of a
beautiful white. Many of them had, unfortunately,
become so fractured as to make identification difficult.
On following the line of the dorsal vertebr&aelig;&mdash;somewhat
scattered about&mdash;I came upon some vertebr&aelig; which
appeared to me to be cervical vertebr&aelig;; and then,
behold my joy! in searching around the summit of the
mound I perceived the skull. The skull was so big
and heavy that I could not carry it away, but I took
several photographs and careful drawings of it from
all sides.</p>

<p>It was curiously shaped&mdash;quite unlike any other
fossil skull I have seen. The cranial region proper was
extremely short, with smallish round orbits rather low
down on the side of the head. The skull had an
elongated shape: 35 cm. was its total length; 10 cm.
its maximum transverse breadth, and 5 cm. at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-372" id="Pg_1-372"></a>[<a href="images/1-372.png">372</a>]</span>
central and widest part of palate. The skull itself,
with an elongated nasal bone, had a flattened point
almost like a beak, or more probably like the base of a
proboscis. The front part of the nose had unfortunately
become fractured and ended with a flattened segment.
A marked arch or hump stood prominent upon the
nasal bone. The temporal arcades were quite developed,
with prominent supra-orbital bosses. The
orbital hollows were 5&frac12; cm. in diameter, whereas the
external nares were 9&frac12; cm., the protrusion in front of
the nostrils being 10 cm. long. The palate, of great
length, had a peculiar complex shape, like a much-elongated
U with another smaller U attached to it in
the centre of its curve, <a href="images/ill1-372.jpg"><img src="images/ill1-372_th.jpg" alt="Symbol." title="Symbol." /></a>.</p>

<p>The skull had been worn down by age and weathering.
Moreover, one side of the upper part of the cranium
had been entirely destroyed&mdash;seemingly by having
rested on red-hot lava. Many of the vertebr&aelig; were
equally injured. By even a superficial examination it
was easy to reconstruct the tragedy which had taken
place on that hillock thousands upon thousands of
years ago.</p>

<p>Searching about, I came upon another skull of a
huge reptile, and a number of smaller vertebr&aelig; than
those belonging to the animal above described. The
second skull was much flattened, of an elongated shape,
very broad, the orbital cavity being high up on the
skull&mdash;in fact, not unlike the skull of a great serpent.
It possessed a long occipital spur, extraordinarily
prominent, and fairly well-defined zygomatic arches&mdash;but
not quite so prominent as in the skull previously
discovered. Seen from underneath, there seemed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-373" id="Pg_1-373"></a>[<a href="images/1-373.png">373</a>]</span>
be a circular cavity on the left front, as if it had contained
a large fang. This skull, too, was also much
damaged on one side, where it had rested on some
burning matter&mdash;evidently lava or lapilli. The skull
measured longitudinally 48 cm. and was 23 cm. broad.
Seen from underneath it resembled a much elongated
lozenge.</p>

<p>Although I searched a great deal I could not find
the lower mandibles of these two skulls, nor loose teeth&mdash;but
many indeed were the fossilized fragments of
bones of other animals strewn all over the hill-top. I
found up there quite a sufficient quantity to make the
summit of that hill look of a whitish colour. That was
why I had been attracted to it at first sight, and had
climbed it in order to discover why it was so white.
One immense bone&mdash;fractured&mdash;was the pelvis of the
larger animal. Nearly all those fossils were in terrible
preservation, much damaged by fire and water. Some
were so eroded as to be quite unidentifiable.</p>

<p>Most interesting of all to me were two smaller
skulls&mdash;one of a mammal not unlike a leopard or
jaguar, the other of an ape or perhaps a primitive human
being. The latter cranium, like all the others, had one
side completely destroyed by hot lava, which in this
instance had also filled up a considerable portion of
the brain-case. The human skull was small and under-developed,
no sutures showing; the forehead extremely
low and slanting, almost flattened, with the superciliary
region and glabella very prominent. One of the orbits
(the right) was badly damaged. The left, in perfect
preservation, was oval, very deep. The form of the
palate was of a broad U-shape&mdash;abnormally broad for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-374" id="Pg_1-374"></a>[<a href="images/1-374.png">374</a>]</span>
the size of the head. The upper jaw was fairly high
and prominent, whereas the zygomatic arch on the left
(the right was destroyed) was not unduly prominent&mdash;in
fact, rather small and less projecting than the supra-orbital
region. Of the nasal bone only just a fragment
remained. The brain-case was small but well-rounded
at the back, where it had comparatively a fairly good
breadth behind the auditory meatus.</p>

<p>In my anxiety and enthusiasm, I used up, in photographing
the first skull I found, the only two photographic
plates which remained that day in the camera
I had brought with me up there. In order to obtain a
fuller view of the skull on the negatives I placed it on a
rudimentary stand I constructed with broken branches
of a tree. The sun had already set when I discovered
the two smaller skulls, and in any case I should not
have been able to photograph them that day. Well
recognizing their immense value, I enveloped them in
my coat, which I turned into a kind of sack by tying
the sleeves together, and, with a number of vertebr&aelig;
and a knee-joint I had collected, proceeded to carry the
entire load, weighing some sixty pounds, back to camp,
a mile away.</p>

<p>On my arrival there I met with a good deal of
derision from my ignorant men. I was faced with a
problem. Had I told the men the immense value of
those fossils, I feared they might be tempted to steal
them and sell them whenever we first reached a civilized
spot&mdash;which, true enough, might not be for many
months; a fact my men did not know and never for
one moment realized. If I did not tell them, I should
have to stand their silly derision as long as the journey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-375" id="Pg_1-375"></a>[<a href="images/1-375.png">375</a>]</span>
should last&mdash;for they openly and loudly argued among
themselves the view that I had gone mad, and what
better proof could they have than my carrying a heavy
load of "ugly stones" as my personal baggage?</p>

<p>Of the two I came to the conclusion that derision
was better than being robbed. So I took no one into
my confidence. I merely stored the fossils carefully
away in a large leather case, meaning to take them
out some day to photograph them as a precaution in
case of loss. Unfortunately the opportunity never
offered itself, for we made forced marches every day,
from early morning until dark, and unpacking and
repacking were very inconvenient&mdash;each package having
loops of rope fastened round, in order to be readily
attached to the saddles, which took much time and
trouble to undo. Then the ridicule of my men each
time the "ugly stones" were referred to also kept me
at first from unduly attracting their attention to them.
With the many things I had to occupy my time day and
night I ended by forgetting to take the photographs&mdash;greatly
owing to being almost certain that I should
bring the skulls themselves safely back to Europe.
But the unexpected always happens. We shall see
later on how&mdash;after having carried those fossils safely
for several months&mdash;they were, unknown to me, wilfully
flung, together with a quantity of provisions, into a
deep part of the Arinos River by my companions, and
they were beyond recovery.</p>

<p>Greatly to my regret, we left that interesting spot
the next morning. A drenching rain prevented my
paying a second visit to the two hillocks where the fossil
fragments were to be found, but I took the exact position<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-376" id="Pg_1-376"></a>[<a href="images/1-376.png">376</a>]</span>
of them, so that any further expedition could locate the
spot with great ease.</p>

<p>It was interesting to note that a Brazilian expedition
had discovered some fossil bones of a gigantic
animal some 200 kil. south-west of that place, and other
remains of a giant animal had been found by another
Brazilian expedition on the banks of the Paranatinga
River, some 400 or 500 kil. north-east of our position.</p>

<p>We were encamped on the bank of the Rio Pedra
Grande&mdash;the stream of that name which we had
passed that day being merely a tributary. During
the night we had observed a double-ringed lunar halo.
The moon was almost full. From the horizon directly
under the moon were innumerable radiations, not converging
toward the moon but, curiously enough, the first
two at a tangent to the larger halo, the others at
equal intervals on each side.</p>

<p>At sunrise, before the rain-storm began, we were
treated to wonderful cloud and light effects. The
lower portion of the sky, of brilliant yellow and vivid
green, was surmounted by golden and red streaks of
wonderful vividness. Later, over the great natural
gateways, the sky formed itself into concentric arches
of blazing yellow and red, rendered intensely luminous
by contrast with the heavy black clouds which were
fast collecting overhead. No sooner was the sun well
above the horizon than we came in for a heavy downpour.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> leaving camp (June 15th) I noticed that the hills
on which I had found the fossils formed a semicircle
to the west. Rising quickly to an elevation of 2,070 ft.,
we were in sight of two great table-lands which
stood to the west. In crossing the river I found a
number of other fossils, among which was one that
appeared to be the petrified foot of an animal of
enormous proportions.</p>

<p>We soon crossed the little stream Lazinha, which
flowed into the Pedra Grande. As we travelled over
two ridges (altitude 2,100 ft. and 2,130 ft.) separating
deep basins, and the weather cleared a little, the view
before us of the entire line of natural gateways, with
two additional pyramidal and prismatic peaks to the
south, became more and more beautiful. There was
a strong breeze blowing from the north-east. At an
elevation of 2,150 ft. we found quantities of marble
chips and blocks and great masses of ferruginous,
froth-like rock.</p>

<p>As we went along we obtained an imposing view to
the north of an immense plateau in three terraces, the
lower one appearing like the sea&mdash;it was so blue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-378" id="Pg_1-378"></a>[<a href="images/1-378.png">378</a>]</span>&mdash;with
the brilliant red upper portion rising out of it
like a great island. The foreground of dark green, in
great undulations, stood out in contrast to the light
green of the slopes of the plateau on the top of which
we were marching.</p>

<p>Central Brazil was certainly a country of flat sky-lines&mdash;so
flat that often when the distance became
of a pure cobalt blue one had the impression of overlooking
an immense ocean, to which the green undulations
in sweeping lines in the nearer foreground added
the impression of great waves.</p>

<p>It was indeed difficult to realize the stupendous
magnitude of the scenes we constantly had before us.
That day, for instance, the plateau to the north of
us stretched across towards the east for 70&deg; of the
compass from bearings magnetic 320&deg; (N.N.W.) to 30&deg;
(N.N.E.). Above the plateau was a strange effect
of clouds&mdash;a succession of arrow-shaped, nebulous
masses.</p>

<p>We still came upon basins of grey ashes&mdash;<i>cuvettes</i>&mdash;but
in that region these were deeper than those we
had observed so far, had luxuriant grass, and in the
moist centre the invariable line of <i>burity</i> palm and
heavily foliaged trees.</p>

<p>Travelling on a northerly course, and then to the
north-west, we descended, after having marched 20 kil.,
into a basin (elev. 1,950 ft.) where a thick and wide
deposit of fine white sand and minute crystals covered
the deeper part of the depression. Then, farther on,
the sand was replaced by the usual deposits of grey
ashes which filled the remainder of the basin. A streamlet
which had its birth in the centre of the basin flowed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-379" id="Pg_1-379"></a>[<a href="images/1-379.png">379</a>]</span>
north into the Rio Manso, along one of the many
cracks which were to be seen in that region and in the
depressions we had previously crossed. We came upon
a mighty flow of red and black lava with a somewhat
frothy surface. It was in superposed layers from one
to six inches deep, with an inclination to the east of 15&deg;.
The flow itself had a direction from west to east.</p>

<p>As we were marching by compass, with no trail
whatever, we found ourselves entangled in a swampy
valley with tall reeds, from which we had some difficulty
in extricating ourselves. We eventually had to
retrace our steps for six kilometres in order to find an
easier way for our animals. After an examination of
the country with my telescope from a high spot, I
decided to go westward across a flat swampy plain of
ashes, sand and water&mdash;most troublesome for the mules
and horses. They sank deep into the soft ground and
frequently rolled over, damaging saddles and baggage.
One or two of my men had involuntary baths when the
animals' knees gave way under them.</p>

<p>As soon as we had emerged from that wearisome
marsh the animals and men were so tired&mdash;although
we had only gone 22 kil. from our last camp, without
counting the deviation (28 kil. with deviation)&mdash;that
I had to encamp on the bank of the streamlet Fascin&aacute;,
coming from the west. There we had the laborious task
of spreading to dry all the articles that had got wet&mdash;including
my bedding, tent, and a quantity of my
clothing, which was not packed like all the rest in air- and
water-tight cases.</p>

<p>The stream Fascin&aacute; flowed into the Rio Furnas and
eventually into the Rio Manso to the north&mdash;the latter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-380" id="Pg_1-380"></a>[<a href="images/1-380.png">380</a>]</span>
a tributary of the Cuyab&aacute; River. That region had
been rich in Mangabeira (the <i>Hancornia speciosa</i> M.)&mdash;a
wild lactiferous plant of much value, producing a
fruit called the <i>mangaba</i>.</p>

<p>June 16th. Minimum temperature 54&deg; Fahr.; elevation
1,940 ft. On leaving camp, after a good deal of
trouble in recovering our animals in the morning, as
they had strayed in all directions, we found ourselves
travelling along the edge of a large grassy basin (elev.
2,000 ft.) extending from south-east to north-west,
with a wonderful growth of <i>burity</i> palms; then upon
a second basin (elev. 2,100 ft.) with deep deposits of
ashes. We climbed higher, to 2,150 ft., where we found
a third oval <i>cuvette</i> with a surface layer of ashes&mdash;merely
a continuation of the preceding <i>cuvette</i>. We
here resumed our northerly course, going through what
the Brazilians call <i>chapada</i>, or high land scantily
wooded.</p>

<p>To the south-west we had a high plateau with
round natural towers of red rock, resembling the walls
of a fortress. Those red cylindrical towers stood all
along the summit of the range&mdash;with immense square
blocks of grey rock above them in horizontal strata.
In the centre of that long range could be perceived
a double-tiered crater and several grottoes. In its
northern section the range was vertical, with red and
yellow rocky walls over 300 ft. high. On the summit
of that rocky stratum were other strata with a dip to
the south. Half way up could be observed a red
ledge about 10 ft. thick (also with a dip to the south)
all along the entire length of the range. Colossal
blocks and flows of lava were to be seen 300 yards east<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-381" id="Pg_1-381"></a>[<a href="images/1-381.png">381</a>]</span>
of this range. In one place was an immense natural
arch&mdash;like the work of a skilful mason. At the northern
end of the range stood a castle&mdash;the work of nature&mdash;with
three square towers, and between them numerous
monoliths or pillars standing on walls of columnar
formation.</p>

<p>Evidently there was a crater in that northern part,
the castle-like structure being merely formed by many
superposed layers of yellow lava. Near the throat of
the crater the lava was hard baked and of a bluish
red colour. In the lower section the strata were each
6 ft. thick, under a smooth band, absolutely horizontal,
100 ft. in thickness. There were then two top layers,
each 20 ft. thick, and four more layers each 4 ft. thick,
and slightly wavy. The last ones were somewhat
shattered, and displayed large blocks moved out of
position&mdash;apparently by a volcanic explosion.</p>

<p>In going round the northern corner of the range
more similar buttresses, like towers, were disclosed&mdash;I
could count as many as eight&mdash;projecting out of the
immense vertical block of rock. Those buttresses were
of brown and bright yellow rock. The range had a
general direction from south-east to north-west.</p>

<p>Great deposits of white sand and ashes were noticeable
on the surface. In cuts and in the bed of a
streamlet were strata of consolidated ashes in distinct
layers one inch thick. The foot of the gigantic rocky
mass was at an elevation of 1,700 ft. We were on a
slanting plane forming a conical basin in continuation
of the crater. To the north, where the basin opened,
was a great stretch of cobalt blue in the distance,
which looked just like a glimpse of the ocean. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-382" id="Pg_1-382"></a>[<a href="images/1-382.png">382</a>]</span>
it was not; it was the far-away plateau we had seen
for some days.</p>

<p>We were now entering a region of the most impressive
and weird scenery I had ever seen, except,
indeed, in the Himalaya Mountains. Directly in front
of us towered the Morro Plum&atilde;o, a most striking
giant block of rock several hundred feet high, standing
quite alone, and resembling a church surmounting
a medi&aelig;val castle&mdash;not unlike St. Michael's Mount,
only with land around instead of water. Even quite
close to it the illusion was perfect. This wonderful
natural structure of dark red rock was in perfectly
horizontal strata, each 10 ft. thick, separated and
clearly defined by whitish lines, which aided to give
the illusion of a wonderful work of masonry.</p>

<p>"Church-rock," as I called it&mdash;or "Spray-rock"
(<i>Plum&atilde;o</i>), as my men named it&mdash;stood majestically in
solitary grandeur in the middle of a great subsidence
of the soil. That great subsidence was in turn bordered
by immense vertical cliffs of the same rock of which
"Church-rock" was formed. Indeed, it was clear that
the soil had given way, leaving only that great rock
standing. Even my men&mdash;for the first time since they
had been with me&mdash;were deeply impressed by that
wonderful spectacle; so much so that they all took off
their hats, as Brazilians always do in passing churches.</p>

<p>We traversed the great depression, which gave us
irrefutable evidence of what had taken place in that
zone. The great rocky, plateau-like mountain to our
left had split and fallen over on the north side,
describing an arc of a circle of 90&deg;. In fact, as we went
along, in places where the rock under foot was exposed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-383" id="Pg_1-383"></a>[<a href="images/1-383.png">383</a>]</span>
we were treading over laminated rock, the stratification
of which was vertical, and corresponded exactly to that
of the upstanding wall where the stratification was
horizontal.</p>

<p>Behind "Church-rock" to the north-west was a
massive plateau, beyond which stretched an immense
undulating depression with two outstretching spurs
from south-west to north-east upon it. "Church-rock"
was 26 kil. from our last camp.</p>

<p>On the north side of "Church-rock," close to the
conical hill upon which the giant quadrangle of rock
rested, was a hump formed by huge blocks, the top
one&mdash;a colossal one&mdash;just balanced, as if it might
tumble over at any moment. Then on the side could
be seen a lava-flow and huge masses of lava which had
been shot up with great force and curled over, retaining
the frothy appearance of its former state of ebullition.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, even when seen from the side
and from behind (N.N.W. view), "Church-rock" retained
all the semblance of a castle and church perched
up on that high pinnacle. From the N.N.W., besides
the castellated towers which surmounted all, there
appeared a perfect representation of a gabled roof over
the body of the church, as well as the flying buttresses of
the walls. Behind was a great cylindrical annexe with
a semi-spherical superstructure, such as is often to be
seen behind Roman Catholic churches. The illusion
was really wonderful.</p>

<p>Owing to the pools of water not far from "Church-rock"
we called that spot <i>Caponga de la Lag&otilde;a</i>.</p>

<p>A few hundred yards beyond "Church-rock" we
came upon another extraordinary sight: a quad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-384" id="Pg_1-384"></a>[<a href="images/1-384.png">384</a>]</span>rangular
rocky castle&mdash;a perfect cube of rock&mdash;which
stood at a considerable elevation upon a conical base,
some distance off the wall-like sides of the plateau.
Strangely enough, a thin wall of rock, only a few feet
thick, quite vertical, of great height and of great length,
joined this quadrangular castle to the plateau. That
wall had evidently remained standing when the plateau
had subsided. The larger plateau along the foot of
which we travelled ended in two great domes, one at
each angle of its eastern terminus wall. The eastern
part of that plateau was flat-topped, whereas the central
portion rose into a double pyramid and looked not
unlike a giant tent with a porch attachment. It was
of a bright yellow colour&mdash;apparently sandstone and
ashes. The work of erosion had been greater on the
eastern face&mdash;owing, I think, to the prevalent wind on
that side.</p>

<p>On looking back upon the great range of rock
which ended abruptly near "Church-rock" (which,
as we have seen, once formed part of it), a great semicircular
cavity was disclosed on its western face. The
summit of the wall around the cavity rested on an
inclined plane, which in its turn rested above a vertical
concave wall. The latter wall of rock had conical buttresses
at the terminal points.</p>

<p>West-north-west of the great wall was an immense
depression. Only a conical hill rose above its last
undulations. The upper edge of that depression was
at an altitude of 1,550 ft. above the sea level, whereas
the top of "Church-rock" was fully a thousand feet
higher&mdash;viz. 2,550 ft.</p>

<p class="figcenter">(Side view.)</p>
<hr />
<p>At the terminus of the first section of the cliff range,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-385" id="Pg_1-385"></a>[<a href="images/1-385.png">385</a>]</span>
interrupted by a great fissure from the second section,
another structure in course of formation not unlike
"Church-rock" could be observed. It had a quadrangular
tower surmounting it. There was in the
second section of the range a regular quadrangle of
rock, with a high tower upon a conical hill, and another
castle-like structure surmounting a conical base. The
two were most impressive as they stood in their sombre
red against the brilliantly blue sky.</p>

<p>Next to the second section of the range, to the
north, was a high mountain of two twin-pointed peaks,
shaped like a badly-pitched tent. Then came another
plateau, much eroded on its south side. Beyond was
an immense black plateau on three successive tiers&mdash;and
this one, unlike the others of which it was merely
a continuation, had sloping instead of vertical sides.</p>

<p>We had a nasty experience that day, which for the
moment made us forget the beauty of that wonderful
scenery. We were going through high scrub and stunted
trees and tall grass, much dried by the intense heat&mdash;quite
suffocating in the basin with the refraction from
the huge rocks. A strong breeze sprang up, and we
were delighted&mdash;when we saw, fast approaching, a
dense black and white cloud rolling, as it were, along
the ground. As it got nearer there were such loud
crackling and explosions that it seemed like the volleys
of musketry in a battle. My horses and mules pricked
up their ears, lifting their heads high&mdash;sniffing, neighing,
and braying. They became restless. Before we had
time to realize what was the matter, we saw tongues
of flames shoot out from the earth. Within a few
seconds, with the wind which was blowing high, we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-386" id="Pg_1-386"></a>[<a href="images/1-386.png">386</a>]</span>
found ourselves with a barrier of fire close upon us
behind and fast gaining upon us. The trees seemed
to flare up in a moment like matches or fireworks. A
wave of terrific heat took our breath away. We were
almost suffocated. There was only one way of escape&mdash;in
front of us. For to the left we had the impassable
barrier of rock; to the right the flames had already
gained on us in a semicircle like a claw of fire. We
stirred on our animals, lashing them. My men, with
their heads wrapped to prevent suffocation from the
stifling smoke, were in a great state of excitement.
They were about to abandon the animals in order to
save their own lives; but Alcides, Filippe, and I kept
the rear, endeavouring to save men, baggage, and
animals. The flames gained on us very quickly. They
occasionally almost licked our animals. The mules
and horses, now fully enveloped in dense, choking
smoke, began to stampede, and soon all the animals
were galloping away, sniffing, neighing and braying
frantically. In their disorderly flight they crashed
against trees and tore off branches; stumbled over
rocks and rolled over themselves; struggling up on
their feet only to resume their mad race for life.</p>

<p>For some little time it was all we could do to keep
a few yards in front of the flames, the heat of which
was roasting our backs and necks. At last, in a desperate
effort, we managed to get slightly ahead, and
when we descended&mdash;some of the animals rolled down&mdash;into
a deep depression, we found ourselves clear of the
smoke. The wind was unfortunately blowing the way
we were travelling, but in that depression we were
sheltered, and the fire would not travel so fast. Our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-387" id="Pg_1-387"></a>[<a href="images/1-387.png">387</a>]</span>
eyes were smarting terribly and we were coughing
violently, our parched throats and lungs, filled with
the pungent smoke, giving us a feeling of nausea.
When we had reached a point of comparative safety we
had to readjust all the loads on the pack-saddles, which
had almost come undone. It was a wonder to me that
in the precipitous flight we had lost nothing.</p>

<p>We had unavoidably deviated several kilometres
from our course, as the animals were beyond guiding
under those circumstances. Eventually, after a considerable
detour in order to avoid the flames, we went
over several undulations&mdash;especially a peninsula-like
spine of rock rising over a great depression, then between
two twin mountains. We emerged on the bank
of the Rio Manso, flowing northward on a pebbly bed.
We crossed it where it was one hundred metres wide,
but only 2 to 3 ft. deep. There was a thick growth of
vegetation&mdash;a belt some hundred yards wide&mdash;on both
banks of the river. The Rio Manso was there at an
altitude above the sea level of 1,150 ft.</p>

<p>I took observations for longitude, and latitude by
double altitudes at that place. (Lat. 13&deg; 53&#8242; S; Long.
55&deg; 13&#8242; W.) I had to halt there one day in order to give
the animals a rest, after the long and reckless march of
the previous day&mdash;a distance of 42 kil.</p>

<p>The source of the Rio Manso was to the E.S.E. some
120 kil. from the place where we crossed it. Where we
encamped it received a small streamlet, flowing over a
bed of laminated igneous rock and several successive
strata of slate, which in some places were in a vertical
position, in others at an angle of 40&deg;. I noticed this
vertical foliation and these laminated strata all over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-388" id="Pg_1-388"></a>[<a href="images/1-388.png">388</a>]</span>
the great depression we had crossed in order to reach
the Rio Manso.</p>

<p>The Rio Manso, which flowed into the Cuyaba
River, was not to be confounded with the Rio Manso
forming the head-waters of the Rio das Mortes, which
eventually threw itself into the River Araguaya.</p>

<p>Owing to one of my animals having strayed away
and the difficulty of finding it again in the tall grass
and high vegetation, we were not able to leave camp
until the afternoon of June 18th. Soon after starting
on the march we went through a marvellous arch of
thick foliage, creepers, bamboos, and <i>akur&iacute;</i> palms,
previous to crossing a streamlet 9 metres wide and 1 ft.
deep&mdash;flowing towards the west. We had no end of
trouble near these streamlets, as they flowed between
precipitous banks 50 to 70 ft. high. There was no trail.
The animals frequently lost their footing over the
slippery, steep slope, and rolled down, baggage and all,
until they reached the bottom; or else they would
sometimes stick half way down against trees and liane,
and we had the greatest difficulty in extricating them
again.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill1-388.jpg"><img src="images/ill1-388_th.jpg" alt="Quadrangular Rocky Mountain connected by Natural Wall of Rock with the Vertical-sided Range in Background." title="Quadrangular Rocky Mountain connected by Natural Wall of Rock with the Vertical-sided Range in Background." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Quadrangular Rocky Mountain connected by Natural Wall of Rock with the Vertical-sided Range in Background.</p>
<hr />
<p>There was a low range extending from north to
south along the left bank of the Rio Manso. From a
hill 1,470 ft. high above the sea level on the right bank
of the river we saw a plateau in four terraces&mdash;the third
of the line of plateaux we had seen on our preceding
march. Upon getting higher we perceived to the south,
beyond the four-terraced plateau, another plateau with
vertical walls, and to the south-west a high double-humped
dome&mdash;resembling Mount Vesuvius in Italy.
Evidently one more of the innumerable extinct volcanoes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-389" id="Pg_1-389"></a>[<a href="images/1-389.png">389</a>]</span>
to be seen in that region. The mountainous mass
extended in a more confused form farther to the south-west.
On our side of the Rio Manso the country was
gently undulating&mdash;in fact, it formed many parallel
ridges of low, well-rounded hills with occasional deep
hollows or basins between. One could not help being
particularly struck by the wonderful regularity and
strong similarity of the curves on the parallel hill ranges,
as if all had been turned out of the same mould. The
hill-range we were on was 1,500 ft. above the sea level.
The others&mdash;excepting one or two&mdash;were lower.</p>

<p>There was an absolutely flat horizon line to the
north, with no mountain range in sight. The country
opening up before us was from that point almost
entirely made up of campos, with <i>chapada</i> or growths
of trees principally near streams in the valleys. We
crossed a watercourse 30 metres wide and 1 ft. deep
at an elevation of 1,350 ft. We called it the Palmeira,
owing to the many palms upon its banks. Here grew
many great <i>caja</i> or <i>cajazeiro</i> trees (of the genus Anacardiace&aelig;),
the largest and tallest trees I had yet seen in
Brazil, and <i>Garappa</i> or <i>Garabu</i> (of the genus Terebinthace&aelig;)
trees&mdash;very interesting on account of their
peculiar winged roots. They resembled the <i>nonoko</i>,
which were characteristic of the Polynesian Islands and
Philippine Archipelago, only the Brazilian ones never
attained proportions so large.</p>

<p>With endless trouble we had gone 20 kil. We had
come to streams, where again, owing to the precipitous
descents on the slippery high banks, several
mules fell over and rolled down into the stream. One
mule, particularly, had become very nervous on ap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-390" id="Pg_1-390"></a>[<a href="images/1-390.png">390</a>]</span>proaching
those places. Foreseeing the punishment
which would be meted out, its knees invariably began
to tremble and give way, and it let itself roll down purposely,
every time we came to those difficult passages.
Once down at the bottom, with baggage often immersed
deep in water, we had the greatest difficulty in making
the wretched animal get up again, and we frequently
had to drag it bodily up the opposite slope by means of
ropes. I have never seen an animal stand more beating
than that brute did. Although I am most kind to
animals, I must say for my men that this particular
mule often drove us all to absolute despair. Dragging
the dead weight of an animal up a steep slope, 40, 50,
or even 70 ft. high&mdash;we were only seven men&mdash;was no
joke at all. When you had to repeat the operation
several times a day, it was somewhat trying. Once
the brute had been dragged up to the top it would
quickly get up on its legs, and marched well while on
fairly good ground. But in moments of danger it was
one of the most pusillanimous animals I have ever
possessed.</p>

<p>I had given strict orders that in places of that kind
the more timid animals were to be unloaded, and the
loads conveyed across on men's backs. My orders
were always disobeyed. The result generally was that
not only did the men have to carry the loads eventually,
but we had to carry the animals as well. Endless time
and energy were thus wasted. That is what happens
to people who try to save themselves trouble.</p>

<p>At sundown, after having witnessed a glorious view
of the valley to the north, we descended rapidly amidst
luxuriant vegetation of tall bamboos, <i>akur&iacute;</i> palms, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-391" id="Pg_1-391"></a>[<a href="images/1-391.png">391</a>]</span>
festooned liane, until we reached the Palmeira River,
flowing from north to south. Having crossed it, we
continued for 3&frac12; kil. through dense vegetation, and
then recrossed it at a spot where it passed within
enormous fissures in colossal masses of highly polished
yellow lava. After solidification these masses of lava
had been subjected to violent commotion, as their
stratification was nearly in a vertical position.</p>

<p>Wherever possible I took observations for latitude
and longitude, in order to ascertain my exact position;
an 8-in. sextant, mercurial artificial horizon and
chronometers being used for the purpose. It is not
easy to describe the torture I had to go through when
taking those tedious astronomical observations. The
glass roof of the artificial horizon had unfortunately
got broken. I had to use a great deal of ingenuity in
order to screen the mercury from the wind so as to
obtain a well-defined reflection. No sooner was I
getting a perfect contact of the sun's image and its
reflection than some huge fly or other insect would begin
to promenade on the mercury, disturbing its surface.
Butterflies were even more troublesome, as they left
upon the mercury&mdash;by the luminosity of which they
were greatly attracted&mdash;sediments of multi-coloured
powder and down from their wings and bodies. The
mercury had to be carefully re-filtered before work
could proceed. Then, what was worse, when both
your hands were occupied&mdash;one holding the sextant,
the other gently screwing the vernier&mdash;hundreds of
mosquitoes, taking advantage of your helpless condition,
buzzed round and settled on your nose, ears, neck,
eyelids and forehead, stinging you for all they were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-392" id="Pg_1-392"></a>[<a href="images/1-392.png">392</a>]</span>
worth. Swarms of bees&mdash;a dwarf kind, with body in
yellow and black stripes; fortunately these did not
sting&mdash;also placidly roamed upon every available patch
of skin with a provoking tickling. A great number of
them settled along the edges of the eyelids, attracted
by the sheen of the retina of the eye, into which they
gazed with great interest. Others, more inquisitive,
would explore the inside of your ears; while millions&mdash;actually
millions&mdash;of <i>pium</i>, the tiny gnats&mdash;more
impertinent than all the others taken together&mdash;dashed
with great force up your nose, into your eyes, into your
mouth, and far into your ears, and were most troublesome
to remove. Your ankles and knees and wherever
the skin was soft were itching terribly with <i>carrapatinhos</i>,
and before you got through with your work you were
also swarming all over with ants of all sizes&mdash;careering
all over your body and inflicting painful bites whenever
you placed your hand upon your clothes to arrest their
progress. When you had endured the torture long
enough, and had managed to take a satisfactory solar
observation, you generally had to remove all your
clothes in order to get rid of the unpleasant parasites&mdash;and
you then had a good hour's hard work cut out
for you.</p>

<p>We continued our march northward, the temperature
in the sun being 105&deg; Fahr. The minimum
temperature had been 60&deg; Fahr. during the night of
June 17th, and 64&deg; on June 18th. We crossed the Piraputanga
River, flowing into the Rio Manso, and then
passed over a magnificent flow of yellow, red and
black lava, the Cambayuvah River, a tributary of the
Palmeira.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-393" id="Pg_1-393"></a>[<a href="images/1-393.png">393</a>]</span>
The Cambayuvah flowed through a great volcanic
crack 75 ft. high, the sides of the crack showing much-fissured
strata in a vertical position. A smaller
streamlet entered the Cambayuvah where we crossed it.
Wonderfully beautiful, indeed, were the rapids among
brilliantly coloured red and yellow rocks, the water
winding its way among high upstanding pillars and
sharp blades of laminated rock.</p>

<p>A beautiful waterfall tumbled over with a great
noise into a pool, scooped out of an immense block
of such hardened rock that even the force of that violent
stream seemed to have had but little erosive effect
upon it. The edges of it were as sharp as possible,
instead of being worn smooth and rounded by the
constant rapid flow of water. The rock had been hard
baked, and was of a shiny black colour, almost as shiny
as crystal. At the bottom of those picturesque rapids
was a circular volcanic vent, the periphery of which
had been blackened by the action of fire. The Cambayuvah
followed a general course of south-east to
north-west.</p>

<p>We camped near that enchanting spot&mdash;most
picturesque, but terrible for my animals, as the grazing
was poor. My mules, when let free at the end of the
march, stood helpless around the camp, looking reproachfully
at us, and making no effort to go far afield
in order to get something to eat. The poor things were
quite exhausted. I saw well that they could not last
much longer. My men were constantly worrying me,
and saying that we were going to sure perdition. They
had become painfully home-sick, and had they not
been dead-tired too&mdash;more so, perhaps, than the mules<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-394" id="Pg_1-394"></a>[<a href="images/1-394.png">394</a>]</span>
and horses&mdash;I should have expected great trouble from
them. As it was, to lead on those men with persuasion
and kindness was an exhausting mental effort for me.
Once or twice the suggestion was made that if I did
not agree to go back the way we had come I might
perhaps get killed and they would return alone. When
I enquired whether any of them could find their way
back alone, they said "no"; so I suggested that perhaps
it would be to their advantage to let me live. I
might eventually see them out of that difficulty.</p>

<p>In all my travels I have seldom come across men
more helpless at finding their way about, or realizing
in which direction they had travelled. Barring Alcides,
none of them had any more idea whether we had
travelled south, north, east, or west of Goyaz, than
the man in the moon. Naturally I did not exert myself
to enlighten them unduly, for there lay my great and
only hold over them. I had fully realized that I was
travelling with an itinerant lunatic asylum, and I
treated my men accordingly. No matter what they
did or said, I always managed to have things my own
way. Never by violence, or by a persuasive flow of
language&mdash;the means used by the average mortal. No,
indeed; but by mere gentleness and kindness; very
often by absolute silence. Few people realize the force
of silence on momentous occasions; but of course few
people know how to remain silently silent&mdash;if I may
so express it&mdash;in moments when their life is seriously
at stake. Silence is indeed the greatest force a man
can use, if he knows how to use it. It is certainly
invaluable in exploring, when naturally one is not
always thrown into contact with the best of people.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-395" id="Pg_1-395"></a>[<a href="images/1-395.png">395</a>]</span>
The animals strayed away during the night, and
it took all the best part of four hours to recover them
in the morning. Instinct is a wonderful thing. They
had all travelled to a place where, over undulating
country, fairly open campos, slightly wooded with
stunted trees, were to be found, and where they could
obtain something to eat. When we crossed those campos
after our departure from camp, foliated rock showed
through the surface soil in many spots, in strata either
displaced and left vertical&mdash;in many cases at an angle
of 38&deg;&mdash;or in its original horizontal plane. Elsewhere
dips in all kinds of directions showed that there must
have been a good deal of commotion in that region
when that part of the country subsided and formed the
basin we were then crossing. The typical feature of
all those undulations was their arched backs.</p>

<p>We were at a low elevation&mdash;only 1,300 ft. above
the sea level. We were travelling over immense quantities
of marble pebbles and volcanic d&eacute;bris. We there
made the acquaintance of the <i>gramadin</i>, a plant with
curved spikes, which seldom attained a height of more
than one inch above the ground. It was terribly
poisonous if touched.</p>

<p>We went over three successive ridges (elev. 1,300 ft.).
On the summit of each ridge we found a profusion of
marble d&eacute;bris and even large blocks immaculately
white or else yellow&mdash;probably rendered of the
latter colour by contact with iron, plentiful in that
region.</p>

<p>On the summit of the sixth ridge (elev. 1,330 ft.),
that day, we came upon large sheets of foliated rock&mdash;again
almost absolutely vertical in its stratification<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-396" id="Pg_1-396"></a>[<a href="images/1-396.png">396</a>]</span>&mdash;and
great masses of thin slate plates or foliations extending
from east to west.</p>

<p>Farther on, from a high point, 1,450 ft. above the
sea level, we could gaze once more upon a gorgeous
panoramic view of the marvellous scenery we had left
behind&mdash;the great plateaux of rock as red as fire, and
"Church-rock" looming high against the sky. We
kept on rising upon various undulations&mdash;that day's
march was one of continuous ascents and descents.
At 1,600 ft. we found more masses of vertically foliated
slate, ashes consolidated into easily-friable sheets, and
large quantities of beautiful marble.</p>

<p>To the north and north-east we had delightful
scenery, the <i>pao d'arco</i> trees in full bloom, of a reddish-purple
colour, adding greatly to the vivid colour-scheme
of that view, with its cobalt blue of the distant mountains
and the Veronese green of the campos in the foreground.
Nearly all the ridges we had crossed which
extended from north-east to south-west were well
rounded&mdash;fairly well padded with sediments of earth,
sand and ashes.</p>

<hr />
<p>We descended to 1,300 ft. (above the sea level)
through thin forest, in a valley where bamboo was
abundant as well as <i>gamelleira</i> trees with their winged
roots of great size. The <i>gamelleira</i> was somewhat
larger than the <i>garappa</i> or <i>garabu</i>. We found in that
valley a beautiful grove of <i>akur&iacute;</i> palms, the palms being
10 to 15 ft. high. In going through&mdash;cutting our way
with <i>falcons</i>&mdash;long heavy-bladed knives specially made
for cutting through forests&mdash;we were much worried by
spiders' webs of great size, from which we had trouble
in extricating our heads and hands as we went along.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-397" id="Pg_1-397"></a>[<a href="images/1-397.png">397</a>]</span>
There were thousands of those webs at the entrance of
the forest, and we dragged them all along on our
passage. With their viscous properties they clung to
us, and we could only shake them off with difficulty.</p>

<p>Most interesting of all was the <i>cepa d'agua</i>&mdash;a powerful
liana, four inches in diameter, festooned from the
highest branches of trees, and which when cut ejected
most delicious cool water. Then there was a tree called
by the Brazilians "<i>mulher pobre</i>," or "poor woman's
tree"&mdash;do you know why?&mdash;because from its juice it
was possible to make soap, which saved the expense of
buying it. There was a roundabout way of reasoning
for you.</p>

<p>Eighteen kilometres from our last camp we came to
a rapid streamlet of the most limpid water, the Rio
Mazagan (elev. 1,300 ft. above the sea level), four metres
wide and four inches deep. When we drank it it nearly
made us ill, so foul was its taste of sulphur and lead.
The treacherous stream flowed into the Cuyab&aacute; River.</p>

<p>There were many <i>tamburi</i> trees of great proportions,
handsome trees with clean, healthy white bark and
minute leaves&mdash;at the summit of the tree only. In the
forest, although the taller trees were generally far apart,
none of them had branches or leaves lower than 30 to
40 ft. from the ground. The <i>angico</i> or <i>angicu</i> (<i>Piptadenia
rigida</i> Benth.), which was quite plentiful, was
also a good-looking tree of appreciable height and
circumference.</p>

<p>Upon emerging from the beautiful forest, quite clear
underneath with only a few ferns, we crossed great
campos&mdash;"<i>campina grande</i>," as my Brazilians called
them. Skirting the forest in a northerly direction, we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-398" id="Pg_1-398"></a>[<a href="images/1-398.png">398</a>]</span>
went over a low hill range with delightful clear campos
and patches of forest. We crossed another streamlet
of foul-tasting water&mdash;with a strong flavour apparently
of lead.</p>

<p>In the great undulating valley we left behind&mdash;as
we now altered our course slightly to the north-west&mdash;was
prominent a double-humped hill which rose higher
than any other except in the north-west portion of the
landscape. There a high chain of hills could be seen.</p>

<p>When we crossed over the second ridge (elev.
1,400 ft.), strewn with yellow lava pellets, at the end
of extensive campos we obtained an imposing view to
the north. An elevated flat-topped table-land of great
magnitude rose in front of us&mdash;a perfectly straight line
against the sky, but terminating abruptly with three
gigantic steps, with a subsidiary one upon the second
step, at its western end. This plateau stood out, a
brilliant mass of cobalt blue with great projecting spurs,
like a half-section of a cone surmounted by a semi-cylindrical
tower along the southern wall of the plateau.
Then a strange hill mass of four distinct composite
domed heights with minor peaks stood between the
plateau and us&mdash;and extended, like most of the other
ranges, from south-east to north-west.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> had gone 96 kil. in four days' marching since leaving
the Rio Manso. We were only a few kilometres from
the Serra Azul, or Blue Mountains&mdash;truly mountains
of the most vivid and purest cobalt blue I had ever
seen&mdash;quite a wonderful spectacle.</p>

<p>We made our camp in a prairie with good grazing
for our animals. Although we were at a comparatively
low elevation&mdash;1,150 ft. above the sea level&mdash;the minimum
temperature of the atmosphere was 56&deg; Fahr.
during the night.</p>

<p>On leaving camp&mdash;still proceeding north&mdash;we descended
to 1,100 ft. into a lovely stretch of magnificent
grass with a lagoon. The level of the water was low,
as we were then at the end of the dry season. On the
flat grassy land were curious semi-spherical mounds,
4 to 6 metres in diameter and from 2 to 6 ft. high. On
each of these mounds were a few stunted trees. No
trees whatever existed except upon these small mounds,
the explanation being, I think, that the mounds had
formed around the trees while these were growing, and
not that the trees had grown upon the mounds.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-400" id="Pg_1-400"></a>[<a href="images/1-400.png">400</a>]</span>
As we were getting nearer, the Serra Azul to the
north was most impressive. I think that it was partly
due to the bluish foliage of the vegetation upon it that
the range, even close by, appeared of so vivid a blue,
and also to the deep blue shadows cast by the spurs
which projected, some to the south-east, others due
south&mdash;that is, it will be understood, on the southern
face of the range.</p>

<p>Thick deposits of cinders lay in the valley. On
approaching an intermediate and lower range we cut
our way through scrub&mdash;chiefly of <i>sciadera</i> trees, seldom
growing to a greater height than 7 ft. The domed hills
showed through the grass great blocks of volcanic rock,
while at the foot of the hills could be noticed huge
boulders of consolidated ashes with veins of crystals
and marble. There, too, the stratification was vertical.
There was lamination in some of the rock, but not in
the granite blocks nor in the blocks of marble, which
appeared to have been subjected to enormous heat.
Some of the rock had been in a state of absolute
ebullition.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill1-400.jpg"><img src="images/ill1-400_th.jpg" alt="Marvellous Scenery of the Central Brazilian Plateau." title="Marvellous Scenery of the Central Brazilian Plateau." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Marvellous Scenery of the Central Brazilian Plateau.</p>
<p class="figcenter">"Church rock" standing in the centre.</p>
<hr />
<p>At the spot where we crossed the range&mdash;starting
our ascent from an elevation of 1,100 ft.&mdash;were immense
holes, vents and cracks in the earth's crust. As we
rose slightly higher among many chains of low hills,
we were upon a horizontal stratum of laminated granite.
Higher still we passed a semicircular hill composed of
immense blocks of granite. In the centre of the semicircle
was a great round hole, 30 ft. in diameter&mdash;an
extinct crater. Farther on, ascending upon an inclined
plane, we came to another similar semicircle&mdash;not of
rock that time, but of red earth and cinders. When we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-401" id="Pg_1-401"></a>[<a href="images/1-401.png">401</a>]</span>
reached the highest point (elev. 1,270 ft.) of the divide
we had to our left huge pinnacles and pillars of rock
of the most fantastic shapes, monoliths from 10 to 15 ft.
high, and rocks hollowed by the action of fire. Big
boulders, which had become perfectly rounded by having
been shot through the air and revolved at a great speed
while in a half-solid condition, were to be seen scattered
all over the inclined planes of the saddle of the divide.
Giant cacti grew in abundance in the interstices between
rocks. Although most of the rocks were blackened
outside, by chipping off the outer surface one found
that they contained inside beautiful white marble or
else greyish granite. The latter was striated with thin
layers&mdash;not more than a quarter or half an inch thick&mdash;of
crystallized matter, forming veins in the blocks or
dividing two strata.</p>

<p>Everywhere could be noticed remarkable perforations
of all sizes in the rocks, great spherical or ovoid
hollows, or cylindrical tubular channels. In the ground
were many volcanic vents with lips baked by fire.</p>

<p>On our right, a kilometre or so farther on, after
having gone through an extensive stretch of red sand
and lapilli, we came across three hills, the central one
of which had the appearance of a cylindrical tower of
masonry with windows and doors. It was a wonderful
freak of nature. Under this huge tower were several
caves and grottoes.</p>

<p>Descending upon the opposite side of the range, at
an elevation of 1,200 ft. we found the dry bed of a
streamlet, which flowed in a northerly direction when it
did flow at all. On emerging from the wide hill mass&mdash;about
18 kil. across&mdash;we found ourselves among a lot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-402" id="Pg_1-402"></a>[<a href="images/1-402.png">402</a>]</span>
of <i>burity</i> palms on the western spur of the Serra Azul.
When we were actually upon them, the Blue Mountains
lost their blue appearance and were more of a greyish
green, owing to the vegetation which covered most of
their slopes. The range was formed of three distinct
terraces, the lower one being of greater height than the
two upper ones. A number of low hill ranges starting
from the main range branched off like spurs towards
the south. The uppermost terrace of the main range
was supported on a high vertical wall of red rock.</p>

<p>On meeting the Rio Coralzinho we skirted it for
some distance through the forest, then marched among
a great many domes, small and large; after which we
crossed a wonderful field of huge monoliths, superposed
boulders, and rocks of all kinds of fantastic shapes.</p>

<p>We had marched 30 kil. that day. We encamped
on the River Piraputangas&mdash;a tributary on the left side
of the Cuyab&aacute; Grande River&mdash;the Cuyab&aacute; Grande
being in its turn a tributary on the right of the Cuyab&aacute;
River.</p>

<p>The Cuyab&aacute; River described almost an arc of a
circle&mdash;in fact, quite a semicircle&mdash;its birth taking place
in the Serra Azul. Where we crossed it we were only
a short distance to the west from its point of origin.</p>

<p>Where we had made our camp we were in a large
grassy plain about six kilometres long and nearly two
kilometres wide. The rainy season was fast approaching.
We came in for a regular downpour during
the night, accompanied by high wind, which knocked
down all our tents, as the pegs would not hold in the
soft, moist ground. We had a busy time endeavouring
to protect the baggage. We all were absolutely soaked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-403" id="Pg_1-403"></a>[<a href="images/1-403.png">403</a>]</span>
The minimum temperature was 52&deg; Fahr. In the
morning, after the wind had abated and the rain had
stopped, we were enveloped in thick fog.</p>

<p>We had descended to so low an altitude as 750 ft.
above the sea level on the north side of the Serra
Azul&mdash;the lowest elevation we had been at for some
considerable time. We had descended altogether from
the highest part of the great Central Brazilian plateau.
From that point all the waters would be flowing to
the north-east or north. We were, in fact, within a
stone's throw&mdash;to be more accurate, within the radius
of a few kilometres&mdash;of the birthplace of the Rio
Novo, the head-waters of the River Arinos, of the
Rio Verde (Green River), and of the several sources
of the Rio S. Manoel or das Tres Barras, or Paranatinga;
and not distant from the sources of the great
Xingu River.</p>

<p>The Serra Azul, extending from west to east, was
interesting geographically, not only because it marked
the northern terminus of the highest terrace of the
great central plateau, but also because from it or near
it rose two of the greatest rivers of Central Brazil&mdash;the
Xingu and the Arinos (Tapajoz), the latter the
most central and important river of Brazil, crossing
the entire Republic from south to north, as far as the
Amazon.</p>

<p>On June 21st we crossed the Piraputangas (elev.
750 ft. above the sea level), where, owing to the steep
banks, we had much difficulty in taking mules and
baggage to the opposite side. We then proceeded
across another large plain, skirting the spurs of the
Serra Azul. Nine kilometres from camp we came to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-404" id="Pg_1-404"></a>[<a href="images/1-404.png">404</a>]</span>
stream 80 metres wide, which flowed from north-east
to south-west. It had an average depth of 1&frac12; ft. It
was, I think, the Cuyab&aacute; Grande.</p>

<p>It was not easy to identify those rivers, as the
existing maps of that country were absolutely worthless,
most of them being filled in with fancy mountains
and rivers, which either did not exist at all or were
sometimes hundreds of kilometres out of their position.
There were frequently mistakes of two, three, and
more degrees in the latitudes and longitudes even of
important places. As for the tributary rivers, of which
merely the mouths were known and named, they had
supplied good material for the imagination of more
or less artistic cartographers in order to fill in the
rest of their course. Even the German map and the
American maps of the International Bureau of American
Republics, which were the two best, were extremely
inaccurate in their representation of that region. For
instance, the latter map&mdash;and nearly all the other
maps&mdash;placed the Serra Azul some 180 or 200 kil.
south of its actual position. The German map was
some 70 kil. out. The Serra Azul could be seen from
a great distance, and had been marked approximately
and not by actual observations on the spot. Nor, of
course, had the tributaries of the Cuyab&aacute; been explored
or even seen except at their mouths; hence their
imaginary courses.</p>

<p>Considering how the maps of those regions had
been got together, it was really wonderful that, with
all their blunders, they gave as much information as
they did. Unhappy, nevertheless, would be the poor
traveller who relied on those maps in making a journey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-405" id="Pg_1-405"></a>[<a href="images/1-405.png">405</a>]</span>
across the country. For instance, if you expected to
come upon a certain river in one day and did not get
there until after ten or fifteen days' hard marching;
if you expected to find a mountain range&mdash;nearly as
high as the Himalayas or at least as high as the Andes,
according to the deep shading on the maps&mdash;and found
instead an interminable flat plain; and if you saw on
your map rivers marked navigable, and found rapids
instead, in comparison with which the terrible ones of
Niagara are mere child's play, you would certainly
become rather sceptical of prettily-drawn maps.</p>

<p>On most of the maps of Brazil one saw marked to
the east of the Araguaya, in the Goyaz Province, an
immense range with no less a name than Cordilheira
Geral la Serra do Estrondo&mdash;or "General Range of the
Mountains of Noise." They were marked as the most
prominent range in Brazil&mdash;quite as high as the Andes
of Peru, Bolivia, and Chili; whereas, as a matter of
fact, I was told on good authority that they were mere
low hills, where there were any hills at all.</p>

<p>To come to great geographical mistakes which
came under my direct observation, I found a very
palpable one in the head-waters of the Cuyab&aacute; River,
which had their source to the north of the Serra Azul
and not to the south, as marked on many maps, including
the Brazilian official maps.</p>

<p>We had to our left the Serra das Pedra&mdash;"Range
of Rocks"&mdash;an extraordinarily rocky range, which was
crossed almost at right angles by the Chapad&atilde;o das
Porcas. We marched through a wonderful growth of
palmeiras, some of the palms being as much as 30 ft.
high. <i>Buritys</i> were innumerable along a small stream<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-406" id="Pg_1-406"></a>[<a href="images/1-406.png">406</a>]</span>&mdash;the
Rio Estivado&mdash;flowing south-west into the
Cubay&aacute; River. There were great quantities of <i>mangabeira</i>
trees. We proceeded northward along a <i>chapada</i>&mdash;a
capital Brazilian name which denotes a locality
that is neither a forest nor a prairie. The <i>chapada</i>
had scanty trees and scrub, but not enough to make
it into a forest.</p>

<p>We were marching over low hills with surface deposits
of sand and cinders. We gradually reached an elevation
of 1,050 ft. some 18 kil. from camp, and shortly
after&mdash;and only 50 ft. lower&mdash;entered a refreshing
grove of giant <i>palmeiras</i> and <i>buritys</i> along the Rio das
Porcas, flowing westward. There, north of the stream,
we went across more clean campos, 1,700 metres wide,
bounded to the north by the thickly-wooded hill-range
Keboh, extending before us from east to west.</p>

<p>We crossed this range in the centre, during a strong
gale from the south-west. The wind cleared the sky,
that had been overcast and had made the atmosphere
heavy. Again that afternoon, when the wind ceased,
I noticed the peculiar striations in the sky&mdash;not in
straight lines that time, but in great and most regular
curves converging to the west.</p>

<p>The valley got narrower as we went along. Two
twin conical hills ended the northern extremity of the
range (south-east to north-west) which we had on our
left&mdash;a great mass of granite blocks in the centre of
the plain rising higher and higher into regular domes.
The plain itself, on an incline, showed two swellings of
great magnitude, the one to our right about 120 ft.
higher than the plain, the elevation of which was
1,000 ft. On the west side of those two swellings was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-407" id="Pg_1-407"></a>[<a href="images/1-407.png">407</a>]</span>
a confused mass of huge blocks of granite&mdash;of all sizes
and shapes&mdash;which to all appearances had been shot
up from underneath by some internal force. They
were outwardly much blackened by the action of fire,
but internally were of a grey tint. A little farther we
were encircled by basaltic columns of great height,
many of them fractured, forming a fantastic sky-line.
Some resembled the spires of a cathedral;
groups of others had the appearance of the ruins of
an ancient fortress; others stood up like giant obelisks;
while accumulations of others formed more or less
regular pyramids.</p>

<p>After leaving that strange basin, we were once more
travelling across patches of clean <i>chapada</i> and dirty
<i>chapada</i>&mdash;according to the soil and quantity of moisture;
then over arid campos spreading for 15 kil. without
one single drop of water.</p>

<p>At sundown, after having gone over several undulations
varying from 850 to 900 ft. above the sea
level, we went over a hill slightly higher&mdash;950 ft.&mdash;with
a summit of ashes, red earth, and yellow lava pellets,
as well as great sheets of foliated lava.</p>

<p>Under a most wonderful effect of light to the west&mdash;three
superposed horizontal bands of luminous
yellow, violet and brilliant vermilion, over the deep
cobalt mountain range in the distance&mdash;we arrived,
my men being thirsty and tired, at a little rivulet. We
had marched 42 kil. that day.</p>

<p>My men felt the cold intensely during the night&mdash;the
minimum temperature was 48&deg; Fahr., with a high,
cutting wind. Yet we were at a low elevation, merely
750 ft. above the sea level. There were, as usual,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-408" id="Pg_1-408"></a>[<a href="images/1-408.png">408</a>]</span>
moans and groans all night, more toothache and
rheumatic pains and bones aching in the morning. The
discontent among my men had reached a trying point.
They worried me continuously to such an extent&mdash;indeed,
as never in my life I had been worried before&mdash;that
I was within an ace of breaking my vow of never
losing my patience and calm. In my long experience
of exploring I have always had to deal with the most
troublesome types of men imaginable, but never with
any quite so unpleasant as those I had in Brazil.</p>

<p>When, the next morning, I ordered them to pack
the animals in order to proceed on our journey, there
was an unpleasant scene approaching mutiny. They
knocked things about and refused to go on. Then
they sat, rifles in hand, a little way off, grumbling and
grunting, with vicious expressions upon their faces.
They were going to do wonderful things&mdash;they were
indeed! I overheard them. One man came forward&mdash;the
spokesman. The men claimed their money up
to date since the last payment made to them&mdash;only a
fortnight before. They all wished to go.</p>

<p>"Certainly," was my immediate reply. Without a
moment's hesitation they were each handed over their
full pay, and without giving the slightest attention
to them, Alcides, who had remained faithful, and I&mdash;poor
Filippe had been dragged against himself into
the plot&mdash;collected all the animals and packed them.
Without one look or word&mdash;as if they had not existed&mdash;I
started off the troop of animals and got on my saddle
to depart last. With the corner of my eye I kept a
watch on them&mdash;as with men of that kind the chief
danger was when you had your back turned.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-409" id="Pg_1-409"></a>[<a href="images/1-409.png">409</a>]</span>
I had gone only a few yards when I heard some one
sobbing behind my mule. As I turned round, the two
outstretched hands of Filippe were handing me back
the sum of money I had paid a few moments before.
He was begging me to keep it safely for him. Then
two more hands urged me to take back for safe
keeping the wages they had just received. The faces
of the owners of those hands were too comic for words:
the cheeks shining with abundant tears that streamed
down, the eyes red and swollen, the mouths stretched
in nervous strain from ear to ear. Behind came two
more men, looking as mournful as if they were being
led to execution.</p>

<p>They all begged to be re-employed. I let them
follow&mdash;on foot&mdash;for several kilometres without saying
a word&mdash;struggling through the heavy marching painfully
and wading across chest-deep in the streams.
We crossed the Riber&atilde;o Chabo or Guebo, 25 metres wide
and 3 ft. deep, at an elevation of 730 ft., then shortly
after we waded through another stream flowing south,
with a zone of wonderful <i>palmeiras</i> along its banks.
We then emerged into a magnificent plain with a
barrier of low hills to the north-west. Six kilometres
farther we waded across the Planch&atilde;o stream, 5 metres
wide and 6 in. deep. Marching on horseback was delightful,
the maximum temperature being only 74&deg; Fahr. in
the shade. Another stream, flowing from north to south,
the Planch&atilde;onzinho, whose foul water was quite disgusting
to drink, although beautifully limpid, was then
negotiated.</p>

<p>I was delighted at meeting with so many streams, for
there was nothing my men hated more than to get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-410" id="Pg_1-410"></a>[<a href="images/1-410.png">410</a>]</span>
into the water. They felt very sorry for themselves,
to be struggling along as best they could, following the
animals like humble sheep instead of being comfortably
mounted on quadrupeds. We travelled a considerable
distance through campos, but owing to some baggage
which had been lost we eventually had to retrace our
steps as far as the Planch&atilde;onzinho River, on the banks
of which we encamped. This was unfortunate, as the
water had a sickening flavour and made even our coffee
and tea taste like poison.</p>

<p>Misfortunes never come alone. In overhauling my
baggage I discovered, to my dismay, that my men&mdash;in
order to force me to go back the way we had come&mdash;had
gradually thrown away most of the provisions, which
should have lasted us some six to seven months longer.
We had only sufficient food to last us a few days. The
men confessed their misdeed. The country provided
absolutely nothing to eat, and I had to face the problem
of either dying of starvation or falling back on some
place where we could purchase fresh provisions. It
was out of the question&mdash;unless one wished to commit
suicide and a quintuple murder&mdash;to endeavour to push
on towards my goal, Manaos on the Amazon, some
1,600 kil. distant as the crow flies, or at least 4,000
to 5,000 kil. travelling, with possible deviations,
without some of which it was not possible to
travel. We could certainly not fall back on our point
of departure, the terminus of the railway at Araguary,
1,596 kil. distant; nor on Goyaz, the last city we had
seen, 1,116 kil. away&mdash;so that the only way to escape
death was to fall back on the ancient settlement of
Diamantino, the farthest village in Central Brazil, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-411" id="Pg_1-411"></a>[<a href="images/1-411.png">411</a>]</span>
place once established by the first Portuguese settlers
of Brazil while in search of diamonds.</p>

<p>Diamantino was practically in the very centre of
the thicker part of South America, without counting
Patagonia. It was almost equidistant&mdash;roughly speaking,
some 2,560 kil. as the crow flies&mdash;from Pernambuco
on the Atlantic Coast to the east, Callao (Lima) in
Peru on the Pacific Coast to the west, Georgetown in
British Guyana to the north, and Buenos Ayres in the
Argentine Republic. Although so far in the interior
and almost inaccessible from the north, east, and west,
Diamantino could be reached comparatively easily
from the south, travelling by river up the Parana,
Paraguay, and the Cuyab&aacute; Rivers, as far as Rosario&mdash;thence
by trail to Diamantino. I had heard that the
place was once flourishing, but had since become almost
totally abandoned. I thought that perhaps I might
be able to purchase sufficient provisions to get along;
and&mdash;hope being one of my everlasting good qualities&mdash;I
also dreamt that perhaps I might there get fresh men.</p>

<p>It was indeed with a bleeding heart&mdash;when I had
reached a point some 200 kil. north of the Serra Azul&mdash;that
I had to alter my course, which had been practically
due north, into a south-westerly direction, and endeavour
to find Diamantino. My men were delighted at the
prospect of seeing human beings again. We had met
no one for some weeks. We made terrific marches daily
in order to reach that village before the food gave out
altogether.</p>

<p>The nights were cold&mdash;47&deg; Fahr. being the minimum
at our camp on June 23rd.</p>

<p>We crossed a small range of hills over a pass 930 ft.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-412" id="Pg_1-412"></a>[<a href="images/1-412.png">412</a>]</span>
above the sea level, and found ourselves in a spacious
<i>cuvette</i> with the usual central line of <i>buritys</i> and thick
vegetation (elev. 900 ft.). Soaring over our heads were
a number of <i>gavi&atilde;o caboclo</i> (<i>Hetorospidias meridionalis</i>),
a kind of falcon, rending the air with their unmusical
shrieks.</p>

<p>After leaving the <i>cuvette</i> we began to ascend the
Estivado Range, very steep and rocky. Near the
summit we struggled through a field of great igneous
boulders, chiefly upright pillars of granite and white
marble. Upon the pass (elev. 1,400 ft.) was a circular
depression some 300 metres in diameter, perfectly flat-bottomed
and grassy. It was surrounded by cones from
80 to 100 ft. high. On the south-east side of the range&mdash;very
steep&mdash;was abundant rock, whereas to the
north-west side was a padding of brown earth on a
gentle incline divided into terraces. Here and there
pointed noses of volcanic blocks, similar to those we
had found on the opposite side of the range, showed
through. We went across a depression where water
dripping down the mountain-side had remained stagnant,
rendering that spot almost impassable. The animals
sank chest-deep into slush, crashing through the thick
and much-entangled growth of live and fallen bamboos.</p>

<p>More campos, fairly wide, were found beyond this,
and great stretches of foliated slate and sandstone in
strata turned over into a vertical position, and quantities
of d&eacute;bris. Then again we cut our way through a cool
growth of bamboos, handsome <i>palmeiras</i> and <i>akuri</i> palms;
after which we emerged into campos once more, rising
gradually to an elevation of 1,550 ft. upon an undulating
terrace of the second section of the Estivado range.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-413" id="Pg_1-413"></a>[<a href="images/1-413.png">413</a>]</span>
Pulling and pushing the mules and horses over a lot
of boulders and up a steep incline, we reached the
highest point of the range on our route&mdash;1,800 ft. above
the sea level. Again the stratification of red and grey
rock in layers from 6 ins. to 1 ft. thick, standing
vertically, showed what a geological commotion there
must have been in those regions. The summit of the
range, extending from north to south, appeared like
the teeth of a saw, so broken up was it into repeated
undulations. On the west side of the range we found a
gentle slope of clear campos with merely a few stunted
trees upon them.</p>

<p>Before us to the west stood high the level sky-line
of a table-land, showing perfectly straight parallel strata
of rock extending all along its face, but slightly undulated
near the summit of the range. Otherwise its grassy slopes
were quite undisturbed in their virgin smoothness.</p>

<p>In the distance to the north of our course was a
great lagoon&mdash;the Lag&otilde;a dos Veados, "Lagoon of the
Deer"&mdash;a most important point in South America, for
it was there that the great Arinos (Tapajoz) River rose.
The lagoon&mdash;3 kil. long and less than 1 kil. wide&mdash;had
no visible outlet, but some hundreds of metres away a
spring came out of the earth, forming the Rio Preto
(Black River). The Rio Preto, soon joined by the Rio
Novo which we had seen descending from the Serra
Azul, formed the Arinos River and could certainly be
considered the head-waters of that immense tributary
of the Amazon.</p>

<p>A short distance south of Diamantino were the
Sete Lagoas, or Seven Lakes&mdash;as a matter of fact, they
numbered more than seven&mdash;circular pools only a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-414" id="Pg_1-414"></a>[<a href="images/1-414.png">414</a>]</span>
few yards in diameter but extraordinarily deep, evidently
of volcanic origin, and filled with water at a
later time. Around their edges a remarkably luxuriant
growth of <i>buritys</i> could be admired. A great valley
extending south with a central ridge could be distinguished.
On it was the meeting-place of the Rio
Diamantino and the Rio do Ouro (River of Gold),
which, with the Sete Lagoas, formed another most
important point of South America, for it was there that
the Great Paraguay or Parana River rose.</p>

<p>It was thus interesting to note that within almost
a stone's throw rose two of the most powerful rivers of
South America&mdash;one flowing due north into the Amazon,
the other almost due south as far as Buenos Ayres
and Montevideo, where it entered the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>A great confusion is made on most maps between
those lagoons and the actual birth-places of those important
streams. The ancient Jesuits and friars had
a fair idea of geography. I have in my possession a
remarkable work in Italian published in Rome in 1698
by Father John Joseph of S. Teresa&mdash;a barefooted
Carmelite. It is entitled <i>The History of the Wars in
the Kingdom of Brazil between the Crown of Portugal and
the Republic of Holland</i>. The book contains a number
of extraordinary maps of Brazil. Those of the principal
harbours give a splendid idea of the places represented.
The coastline of the continent is indicated with fair
accuracy. It is curious to note that the author of that
book and the cartographer place the sources of the
Amazon and of the River Plate in the same spot, as
descending on opposite sides of a range extending from
east to west&mdash;a range which does not exist, unless it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-415" id="Pg_1-415"></a>[<a href="images/1-415.png">415</a>]</span>
intended to represent the Central Brazilian plateau.
"The River S. Francisco," Father John Joseph goes
on to state, "has also its birth in the spot where the
Amazon is born, but this is not sure." The cartographer,
in fact, places the head-waters of that river
close to the head-waters of the Amazon, and makes them
flow through a large lagoon in the heart of Brazil&mdash;evidently
the Great "Lag&otilde;a dos Veados" or else the
"Sete Lagoas" to which reference has previously been
made in this chapter. "The Rio Grande (Rio Parana,
Paraguay), one of the most celebrated in Brazil,"
proceeds the Carmelite Father, "is born already swollen
by plentiful waters (<i>sic</i>) in the interior of terra firma!
Near its sources it forms a lagoon 20 leagues in circumference."
All this is, of course, geographically
wrong. The Rio S. Francisco has its birth far to the
south-east in Minas Geraes, some hundreds of kilometres
distant from that lagoon and several thousand from the
real source of the Amazon.</p>

<p>Also the friar must have mistaken&mdash;evidently from
information received&mdash;the sources of the Arinos
for the sources of the Amazon, which are really
located some 15&deg; of longitude west. It is nevertheless
curious that so far back as 1698 the existence
of the lagoon should be known at all&mdash;perhaps
they had heard of it from the adventurous Paulista
Bandeirantes&mdash;and that they should have placed it
nearly in its proper latitude and longitude on their
maps. Apparently Father John Joseph was not aware
of the existence of the Great Araguaya and Xingu
Rivers. Having compiled his map from information,
he confused those rivers into the S. Francisco River.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-416" id="Pg_1-416"></a>[<a href="images/1-416.png">416</a>]</span>
Upon descending from the Serra into the valley
we soon came to a large forest with a luxuriant edge
of <i>peroba</i> (a word originating, I believe, from the words
<i>ipe</i> and <i>roba</i> in the <i>Tupi</i> language), which was known
in four different varieties: viz. the <i>peroba amarella</i>
(yellow), <i>parda</i> (brown), <i>revessa</i> (knotty), and <i>rosa</i>
(rose-coloured), technically named: <i>Aspidosperma polyneuron</i>
M. Arg., <i>Aspidosperma leucomelum</i> Warmg,
<i>Aspidosperma sp.</i>, <i>Aspidosperma dasycarpon</i> A.</p>

<p>Then there were also plentiful <i>garabu</i> and other
tall trees. Before getting to the edge of the forest I
noticed among the rocks some beautiful specimens of
the <i>apita</i> cactus, 10 ft. and more in height, in appearance
not unlike giant artichokes.</p>

<p>Near its beginning, where it was 3 metres wide and
6 in. deep, we crossed the Estivado River, which
with a group of other streamlets may share the honour
of being one of the sources of the Arinos. It flowed
in a north-westerly direction.</p>

<p>We were pushing on for all we were worth, for we
had come to the end of our food. Up and down we
went over a troublesome series of great elongated
ridges&mdash;like parallel dunes&mdash;the highest elevation on
them being 2,050 ft., the depressions 1,950 ft. We
came to a sweetly pretty streamlet, the Mollah,
flowing north into the Paraguay River, and shortly
afterwards to the Caitt&eacute; and the Corisho (elev. 1,500 ft.).
They were the three real and true sources of the Paraguay,
within a short distance of the Seven Lakes.</p>

<p>We had marched 50 kil. that day over rough country.
My animals were quite exhausted. Yet early next
morning we pushed on once more over transverse un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-417" id="Pg_1-417"></a>[<a href="images/1-417.png">417</a>]</span>dulations
and across grassy <i>cuvettes</i>, slightly conical,
with circular pools of water in the centre and a florid
growth of bamboos in the lowest point of the <i>cuvettes</i>.
We ascended over more dyke-like obstructions on our
way (elev. 1,700 ft.) and descended once more into a
vast basin of campos with stunted trees. At its lowest
point there was from north-east to south-west a line
of magnificent tall trees. The forest was so dense
there that when we entered it we were quite in the
dark, as if going through a tunnel. There were fine
specimens of various kinds of the <i>jua</i> or <i>juaz</i> or <i>jurubeba</i>
(solanum), a medicinal plant 5 to 6 ft. high with
enormous dentate leaves&mdash;shaped not unlike a vine
leaf&mdash;possessing upright spikes on their dorsal or mid-rib
and on the veins of the leaf.</p>

<p>Then there was plentiful "<i>cepa de pappo</i>," a common
liana like a huge boa-constrictor winding its way in a
spiral up the tallest trees. I saw some of those liane
3 in. in diameter, with a smooth whitish bark.</p>

<p>The soil at the bottom of the valley (1,500 ft. above
sea level) was mostly composed of cinders, but up
the slopes white sand was predominant, mixed with
ashes. We travelled over a lava flow which formed the
bed of the River Macucu, flowing eastward. Guided
by the noise, we found a most beautiful waterfall, 100 ft.
high, over an extinct circular crater with vertical walls.
We kept on rising over a gentle incline, and having
reached an elevation of 1,750 ft. we found ourselves
suddenly on the upper edge of a great crescent-shaped
depression extending in a semicircle from north-east
to south-west. Its walls were one-tiered to the west,
with a flat table-land on their summit, but were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-418" id="Pg_1-418"></a>[<a href="images/1-418.png">418</a>]</span>
divided into two terraces in the northern part where
ranges of hills rose on the plateau.</p>

<p>We had a rapid, steep descent among great rectangular
blocks of conglomerate (white marble pebbles
embedded in iron rock), great sheets of lava, and sediments
of red earth, solidified in places into half-formed
rock. I noticed extensive lava flows which had run
towards the west; then we came upon extraordinary
quantities of loose white marble pebbles and chips.
We made our way down upon a kind of spur of red lava,
frightfully slippery for my animals. The poor beasts
were quite worn out with fatigue.</p>

<p>From the round dome of the headland we perceived
to the south a second great circle of flat-topped heights.
The immense flow of red lava on which we were radiated
terrific heat which it had absorbed from the sun's rays.
My dogs, being nearer the ground than we were, had
great difficulty in breathing. Their heads and tails hung
low, and their tongues dangled fully out of their
mouths. They stumbled along panting pitifully. Even
we on our mounts felt nearly suffocated by the stifling
heat from the sun above and the lava below. The dogs
were amusing enough, curling down quickly to rest
wherever a mangy shrub gave the slightest suspicion
of a shade. The men, more stupid always than beasts,
were sweating and swearing freely, and thumped
mercilessly on the rumps of the tired animals with the
butts and muzzles of their rifles in order to urge them
along.</p>

<p>The very sound of the mules' neck-bells seemed tired
and worn; its brisk tinkling of our days of vigour had
given room to a monotonous and feeble, almost dead,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-419" id="Pg_1-419"></a>[<a href="images/1-419.png">419</a>]</span>
ding ... dong, at long intervals&mdash;well suggesting the
exhaustion of the poor animals, which were just able
to drag along. The slightest obstacle&mdash;a loose stone,
a step in the lava, and now one animal, then another,
would collapse and roll down, and we had to dismount
and help them up on their feet again&mdash;quite a hard job,
I can tell you, when the animals were nearly dead and
would not get up again.</p>

<p>As we went along more and more headlands of the
great plateau appeared before us to the west. We
still went on descending on the top of the long spur of
lava. When not too busy with our animals&mdash;and quite
out of breath with the heat and stifling air from the
heated rock&mdash;I sometimes glanced at the glorious
panorama on both sides of us. When we had proceeded
farther I ascertained that there were really two
crescents contained side by side within a larger
crescent. Under us to the south a vast undulating
plain stretched as far as the eye could see towards
the south-west and west. On describing a revolution
upon your heels your eye met the other end
of the larger crescent plateau to the north-west. The
Serra do Tombador extended in a south-westerly direction
from north of Diamantino to S. Luiz de Caceres,
to the west of the Paraguay River. The height of the
spur on which we were was 1,350 ft. above the sea level.</p>

<p>We had come in a great circle on the upper edge.
A trail could be seen crossing the great undulating
valley below us. It passed at the western terminus
of the spur we were on. Evidently that was the trail
connecting Diamantino with Cuyab&aacute; (the capital of
Matto Grosso) via Rosario. The sight of a trail was most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-420" id="Pg_1-420"></a>[<a href="images/1-420.png">420</a>]</span>
exhilarating to my men. Suddenly and quite unexpectedly
we came upon a few wretched, tumble-down
houses&mdash;if one may call them so&mdash;smothered in vegetation
which grew everywhere. My animals themselves
seemed astonished at the unusual sight. The
horses neighed and the mules brayed loudly. Masonry
work perhaps suggested to them more substantial
meals. Down a precipitous ravine, over large boulders
and stumbling into big holes, into which the mules
disappeared for a few seconds at a time ... there was
the main street of Diamantino.</p>

<p>The village&mdash;the local people called it "a city"&mdash;was
the very picture of misery, yet to us it seemed
as if we had dropped into the middle of London or
Paris. There were a few resident traders, two or three
Brazilians, two Italians, and a Turk. All were most
hospitable and kind. The chief industry of the place
was rubber, which found its way to the coast via the
Paraguay River.</p>

<p>Formerly Diamantino was a flourishing place because
diamonds were found in abundance. Even now they
can be found along the river, but the difficulty of access,
even by the easiest way, and the great expense of
living there have gradually depopulated the place,
which was quite in an abandoned state when I was
there.</p>

<p>Here are some of the minimum prices which the
rubber collectors had to pay for articles of necessity:
Beans, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> per litre,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> or about 4<i>s.</i> a pound;
rice, 2<i>s.</i> per litre; flour, 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> per litre, about 4<i>s.</i> a
pound; sugar, 5<i>s.</i> per kilo (2 pounds), rapadura, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-421" id="Pg_1-421"></a>[<a href="images/1-421.png">421</a>]</span>
sugar block, 4<i>s.</i> per small cake; tobacco, 5<i>s.</i> per metre
of twist; salt, 2<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> per litre; coffee, 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
per kilo; lard, 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per kilo; purified lard in tins,
16<i>s.</i> to 20<i>s.</i> per 2 kilos. Bars of the commonest laundry
soap, 4<i>s.</i> each bar; chickens 10<i>s.</i> to 15<i>s.</i> each; eggs,
10<i>s.</i> to 12<i>s.</i> a dozen; small tins or sardines (containing
five sardines) of the most inferior kind, 10<i>s.</i> to 15<i>s.</i> a
tin; a one-pound tin of the commonest French salt
butter, 15<i>s.</i></p>

<p>A genial banquet was offered me on my arrival.
The school-mistress was set to prepare an excellent
and plentiful meal. The mayor and all the notabilities
of the place in their Sunday clothing came to fetch me
at the house of the firm of Orlando Bros., where I had
been most hospitably sheltered, and where I had been
requested to wait for them. At the appointed time
they arrived&mdash;in frock-coats, and each carrying an
umbrella.</p>

<p>"Is it raining?" I inquired in my astonishment
at seeing the array of articles which I had not seen for
several months&mdash;especially as a few minutes before I
had been outside and it was a lovely starlit night.</p>

<p>"Oh no, indeed, it is not raining; we carry the
umbrellas in due honour to you!" they replied in a
chorus, accompanied by a grand bow.</p>

<p>This was such an extraordinary compliment that
it really took me some time before I could grasp the
meaning of it. It seemed that according to the social
rules of Diamantino, Matto Grosso, no one could be
considered fully dressed unless carrying an umbrella.
Rain or shine, the people of Diamantino carried their
umbrellas on grand occasions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-422" id="Pg_1-422"></a>[<a href="images/1-422.png">422</a>]</span>
After that one of the gentlemen pulled out of his
pocket a long slip of paper and proceeded to read a
speech of welcome. I answered in a few humble words.
Another gentleman&mdash;there were eight altogether&mdash;produced
another slip which he duly read in a sonorous
voice. Again I replied as best I could. Then, as I
was getting really anxious lest some one else should be
speechifying again, the mayor of the place offered me
his arm, and followed in a most respectful manner by
the others, we adjourned to the schoolroom, where the
feast was spread upon the table.</p>

<p>More speeches when we entered the room, more
speeches before we sat down, speeches in the middle of
dinner, speeches after dinner. Unaware of what was
coming, I had exhausted all the compliments I could
think of in my first speech, and I had to tax my poor
brain considerably to reply with grace&mdash;especially as I
had to speak in Portuguese&mdash;to the many charming
things which my thoughtful hosts said. The banquet
went off well. It is difficult to imagine more considerate,
kindly people than those exiles in that far-away spot.</p>

<p>I took careful and repeated astronomical observations
for latitude and longitude in order to establish
the exact position of that settlement. Lat. 14&deg; 21&#8242;&middot;7 S.;
Long. 56&deg; 56&#8242; W. I purchased all the food I could
possibly collect&mdash;enough to last us some six months,
which cost me a small fortune&mdash;as I intended to push
out of the place and proceed northward at once.</p>

<p>Four of my men became badly intoxicated upon
our arrival. There was another mutiny. They again
claimed their pay up to date and wished to leave me.
At once they received their money. It was such a relief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-423" id="Pg_1-423"></a>[<a href="images/1-423.png">423</a>]</span>
to me when they went off, even for a few hours, that I
was always glad to give them the money and have a
short mental rest while they kept away. Unfortunately
it was impossible to obtain a single extra man in
Diamantino. Labour was scarce, and the few labourers
in existence were in absolute slavery. Indeed, slavery
existed&mdash;it exists to-day&mdash;in all Central Brazil, just as
it did before slavery was abolished. Only in the old
days of legal slavery it was limited to negroes; now the
slaves are negroes, mulattoes, white people, even some
Europeans. I have seen with my own eyes a German
gentleman of refinement in that humble condition.</p>

<p>In the present condition of things the slave, in the
first instance, sells himself or is sold by his family.
There were indeed few, if any, of the labouring classes
in Matto Grosso and Goyaz provinces who were free
men or women. All were owned by somebody, and
if you wished to employ them&mdash;especially to take them
away from a village or a city&mdash;you had to purchase
them from their owners. That meant that if you intended
to employ a man&mdash;even for a few days&mdash;you
had to disburse a purchase sum equivalent to two or
three hundred pounds sterling, sometimes more. In the
following way it was made impossible for the slaves to
become free again. Taking advantage of the poverty
and vanity of those people, loans of money were offered
them in the first instance, and also luxuries in the way
of tinned food, clothing, revolvers and rifles. When
once they had accepted, and could not repay the sum
or value of the articles received, they became the
property of the lender, who took good care to increase
the debt constantly by supplying cheap articles to them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-424" id="Pg_1-424"></a>[<a href="images/1-424.png">424</a>]</span>
at fifty times their actual cost. The <i>seringueiro</i>, or
rubber collector, had a <i>caderneta</i>, or booklet and the
master a <i>livro maestro</i>, or account book, in which
often double the quantity of articles actually received
by the rubber collector were entered. The debt thus
increased by leaps and bounds, and in a short time a
labourer owed his master, two, three hundred pounds.
The rubber collectors tried hard to repay the debt in
rubber, which they sold to their masters at a low rate;
but it was always easy for the masters to keep the men
in debt.</p>

<p>It must be said for the masters that their slaves were
not in any way ill-treated; on the contrary&mdash;except
that a man was seldom given the slightest chance of
redeeming himself&mdash;they were indeed treated as well
as circumstances permitted. Labour, it must be remembered,
was so scarce and valuable&mdash;it was almost
an impossibility to obtain labour in Central Brazil&mdash;that
it was the care of the master not to lose a labourer.</p>

<p>Much is to be said for the honour of even the worst
types of Brazilians. Although many of them would
not think twice of murdering or robbing a stranger of
all he possessed, they were seldom known to defraud
their owners by escaping. A man who ran away from
his owner was looked down upon by the entire community.
Again, it must be stated that the chances of
escape, in those distant regions, were indeed very
remote. An escaped slave with no money could not
go very far and he would soon die of starvation.</p>

<p>I must confess that, although I tried hard to discover
a way by which labour could be obtained and
retained in Brazil with the existing laws, I could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-425" id="Pg_1-425"></a>[<a href="images/1-425.png">425</a>]</span>
find one practicable except that used by the Brazilians,
viz. slavery.</p>

<p>The people of Diamantino tried hard to induce
one or two men to accompany me&mdash;and I was willing
to buy them out and eventually would have set them
free altogether at the end of the expedition&mdash;but they
were all so terrified of the Indians if they left the
"city" that they preferred to remain slaves.</p>

<p>Alcides had gone round to look for a barber. There
was only one in Diamantino, and he was in prison for the
murder of his wife, or for some other such trifling matter.
Armed with a pair of my scissors, Alcides went to the
prison to have his hair cut. Once there he took the
opportunity to explain to the prisoner that it could be
arranged to procure his escape if he were willing to join
the expedition. The barber&mdash;who had not inquired
which way we should be travelling&mdash;jumped at the
idea. This necessitated having my hair cut too&mdash;rather
a trial with scissors that did not cut&mdash;in order to
arrange matters further in detail. With a special
permission from the local authorities the barber was
let out accompanied by two policemen&mdash;the only two
in the place&mdash;in order that he might reduce my hair by
half its length or more.</p>

<p>While I underwent actual torture in having my
hair clipped&mdash;as the prisoner's hands were trembling
with excitement, and my ears had various narrow
escapes&mdash;Alcides, who, when he wished, had very
persuasive manners, induced not only the prisoner, but
the two policemen&mdash;all three&mdash;to escape and join the
expedition. I must say that I did not at all look
forward to the prospect of my three new companions;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-426" id="Pg_1-426"></a>[<a href="images/1-426.png">426</a>]</span>
but we were in terrible want of hands. I had visions
that my expedition would be entirely wrecked. There
was a limit to human endurance and we could not
perform miracles. We still had thousands of kilometres
to travel over most difficult and dangerous
country. Besides, I reflected, after all, I might only be
performing an act of kindness by relieving the town of
the expense and trouble of keeping its only prisoner, not
to speak of the police force.</p>

<p>All was satisfactorily arranged, when the prisoner
inquired where we were going. You should have seen
his face when I told him.</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" he quickly replied. "No, no, no,
no!" and he waved my scissors in the air. "I will not
come! I will remain in prison all my life rather than
be eaten up by cannibals! No, no, no, no ... no, no,
no, no...!" he went on muttering at intervals as he
gave the last clipping touches to my hair. He hastened
through his job, received his pay in silence, and asked
the policemen to take him back quickly to the prison.
When the chains, which had temporarily been removed,
were put again around his wrists, he departed shaking
his head and muttering again&mdash;"No, no, no, no...!"</p>

<p>The wise policemen, too, said that naturally, as
their prisoner would not escape, they were obliged to
remain and keep guard over him ... it was not through
lack of courage that they would not come; it was
because of their duty!</p>

<p>Of course, Alcides was sadly disappointed, but I
was delighted, when it all fell through.</p>

<p>I owe the success of my expeditions to the fact that,
no matter what happens, I never will stop anywhere.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-427" id="Pg_1-427"></a>[<a href="images/1-427.png">427</a>]</span>
It is quite fatal, on expeditions of that kind, to stop
for any length of time. If you do, the fatigue, the
worry, and illness make it generally impossible to start
again&mdash;all things which you do not feel quite so much
as long as you can keep moving. Many a disaster in
exploring expeditions could easily have been avoided,
had the people known this secret of successful travelling.
Push on at all costs&mdash;until, of course, you are actually
dead.</p>

<p>With my reduced party of two men (Alcides and
Filippe) I had to arrange matters differently, and
decided to abandon part of my baggage&mdash;all things, in
fact, which were not absolutely necessary, taking only
food, instruments for scientific observations, cameras
and photographic plates.</p>

<p>Alcides and Filippe&mdash;who by then had become most
adventurous&mdash;and I were about to start on July 1st,
and were making things ready, when two of my deserters
returned and begged me to take them along again.
They had found living at their own cost rather expensive,
and had realized that it would have been an
impossibility for them to get out of that place again
with the funds at their disposal. Each meal had cost
them a small fortune. Animals were extremely expensive,
and it was then the wrong season for launches
to come up the river as far as Rosario, the nearest port
to the south.</p>

<p>"We will come with you," said they, in a sudden
outburst of devotion. "We will come. We are brave
men. You have always been good and generous to us.
We are sorry for what we have done. Order us and
we will kill anybody you like for you!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-428" id="Pg_1-428"></a>[<a href="images/1-428.png">428</a>]</span>
Brazilians of that class have only one idea in their
heads&mdash;killing, killing, killing!</p>

<p>That was more devotion than I demanded. In
order to spare Alcides and Filippe, and myself&mdash;as the
work thrown upon us would have indeed been beyond
our possible strength&mdash;I re-employed the two men on
the express condition that they should murder no one
while they were with me.</p>

<p>At noon of July 1st, accompanied by a mounted
escort of honour of the leading citizens with the Mayor
at their head, I left Diamantino (elev. 1,030 ft.), travelling
north-east. We ascended to the summit of a
table-land&mdash;the first terrace of which was at an elevation
of 1,250 ft., the higher at 1,600 ft. The last words
I had heard from a venerable old man as I rode out of
Diamantino still rang in my ears.</p>

<p>"You are going to sure death&mdash;good-bye!..."
On reaching the top of the plateau the courteous friends
who had accompanied me also bade me an affectionate
farewell. I could see by their faces and their manner
that they were saying good-bye to one they believed a
doomed man.</p>

<p>"If by chance you come out alive," said the Mayor,
in a tentative way, "we should like to have news of
you."</p>

<p>On dismal occasions of that kind the sky is always
gloomy and black and there is always drizzling rain.
So that day, too, the weather did not fail to add to our
depressed spirits.</p>

<p>On leaving our friends we started to plunge once
more into the unknown. On reaching the top edge
of the plateau we witnessed a wonderful sight, rendered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-429" id="Pg_1-429"></a>[<a href="images/1-429.png">429</a>]</span>
more poetic by the slight vagueness of a veil of mist.
To the south of Diamantino was the Serra Tombador,
extending as far as S. Luiz de Caceres, about 250 kil.
as the crow flies to the south-west. Then below us was
the Lag&otilde;a dos Veados with no outlet, and close by the
head-waters of the Rio Preto (a tributary of the Arinos).
The Serra do Tombador was parallel nearly all along
with the River Paraguay.</p>

<p>Owing to departing so late in the day from Diamantino,
and the time we had wasted on the way with social
compliments, we were only able to go 12 kil. that
afternoon. We halted near the shed of a <i>seringueiro</i>
(rubber collector), at an elevation of 1,530 ft., close to
the Chapes&agrave;, a streamlet flowing into the Agua Fria
(cold water), which in its turn threw itself into the Rio
Preto.</p>

<p>It was muggy and warm during the night&mdash;min.
65&deg; Fahr.&mdash;with swarms of mosquitoes. We were
glad to leave the next morning, following a north-westerly
course across a wonderfully beautiful meadow
with circular groups of trees and a long belt of vegetation
along the stream. It was then that I made my first
acquaintance in Brazil with the <i>seringueira</i> (<i>Syphonia
elastica</i> or <i>Hevea brasiliensis</i>), which was fairly
plentiful in that region. As we shall see, that rubber
tree, producing the best rubber known, became more
and more common as we proceeded north.</p>

<p>In the cuts of rivers, soft red volcanic rock was
exposed, with a surface layer of white sand and grey
ashes in the flat meadow. The padding of earth was
thin. Except close to rivers and in extinct craters
where the accumulations of earth and cinders were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-430" id="Pg_1-430"></a>[<a href="images/1-430.png">430</a>]</span>
often deeper with a good supply of moisture from
underneath, the trees were feeble and an&aelig;mic. There
again I was amazed to find how unstable and weak
most trees were. One could knock them down with a
mere hard push&mdash;as the roots had no hold in the ground,
where they spread horizontally almost on the surface,
owing to the rock underneath which prevented their
penetrating farther than the thin upper layer of earth,
sand, and ashes. If you happened to lean against a
tree 4 or 5 in. in diameter, it was not uncommon to
see the tree tumble down and you too. The wood also
of those trees was very brittle and watery, with no
power of resistance worth mentioning.</p>

<p>Many were the streamlets which flowed into the
Rio Preto at elevations from 1,450 to 1,500 ft., viz. the
Burity Comprido, the Bujui, the Grinko, the Pomba,
the Corgo do Campo, the Riber&atilde;o Grande, and the
Stiva. Many of those streamlets had beautiful beds
of white marble pebbles, which made their cool and
clear water look and taste perfectly delicious. Others,
with soft black mud bottoms&mdash;especially in <i>cuvettes</i>&mdash;were
extremely troublesome to cross.</p>

<p>On the banks of those streams were marvellous
<i>pacobeira</i> palms&mdash;a kind of giant banana palm, attaining
a height of 30 to 40 ft., with a stem, ovoid in section,
of great length, and from which shot out paddle-like
leaves of immense size and of a gorgeous green, 6 to
7 ft. long and 3 ft. wide.</p>

<p>On July 3rd we went through thick, dirty, low
scrub and forest, except along streams, the banks of
which were lined with tall an&aelig;mic trees 1 inch in
diameter with a mere bunch of leaves from branches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-431" id="Pg_1-431"></a>[<a href="images/1-431.png">431</a>]</span>
at the summit. We again met with several <i>cuvettes</i>&mdash;very
grassy, with the usual florid growth of trees in the
centre. Those depressions were 1,400 ft. above the
sea level. From many of the trees hung huge globes,
like tumours. They were nests of <i>cupim</i>, the destructive
white ants (<i>termes album</i>), of which there were swarms
everywhere in that region. In one night they ate up
the bottoms of most of my wooden boxes and rendered
many of our possessions useless. They ate up our
clothes, injured our saddles by eating the stitching&mdash;anything
that was not of metal, glass, or polished
leather was destroyed by those little devils.</p>

<p>We were beginning to descend gradually on the
northern side of the table-land. After crossing a pass
1,350 ft. above the sea level we arrived on a lagoon
to our left. Shortly after we reached the left bank of
the Arinos River, separated there from the lagoon by
a narrow tongue of high land&mdash;some 30 ft. high&mdash;between
the two waters.</p>

<p>It was thus that on July 4th we encamped on that
great tributary of the Amazon. We were still thousands
of kilometres away from its mouth. My animals were
quite exhausted and were unable to continue. Moreover,
the forest near this great river&mdash;already, so near
its birthplace, over 100 metres wide&mdash;would have made
their coming along quite impossible, as the grazing
was getting scarce, and would be scarcer still as we
went on north. Then as the River Arinos took me
in the direction in which I intended to travel, I had
made up my mind to abandon the animals at that spot
and attempt to navigate the river&mdash;diabolical as its
reputation was.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-432" id="Pg_1-432"></a>[<a href="images/1-432.png">432</a>]</span>
We had now travelled on horseback some 2,000 kil.
from the last railway station, of which about 600 kil.
were over absolutely unknown country. Rough as the
travelling had been, it was mere child's play compared
with the experiences we had to endure from that
day on.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The River Arinos&mdash;A Rickety Canoe&mdash;Mapping the River&mdash;The
<i>Siphonia Elastica</i>&mdash;Rubber and its Collection&mdash;An Enormously Rich
Country&mdash;A German in Slavery</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> struck the River Arinos at a point called Porto
Velho. There were at that place the miserable sheds
of three <i>seringueiros</i> (rubber-collectors). I had made
for that particular spot because I had heard that a
big canoe carved out of the trunk of a tree probably
existed there. I was told that the canoe was large
enough to carry many people. It had been constructed,
it seemed, some ten years previously by a
rubber-collecting expedition which came to grief, was
abandoned, and had since been taken possession of by
seringueiros. I had purchased it on chance from its
last owner for Rs. 300,000. With accessories I gave
about Rs. 450,000, or roughly, &pound;30. It was the only
canoe upon that river.</p>

<p>I considered myself lucky, when I arrived at
Porto Velho, to find that the canoe actually existed
at all. There she was, floating more or less gracefully
upon the water. She had a total length of 42 ft.,
was 3&frac12; ft. wide, and had been roughly scooped out of
a giant tree which was not quite straight. Her
lines, therefore, were not as elegant as might have
been expected. For instance, her starboard and port<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-2" id="Pg_2-2"></a>[<a href="images/2-2.png">2</a>]</span>
sides were not absolutely straight lines, but described
curves&mdash;in fact, the port side almost an angle. That
gave the canoe an original appearance, which to my
practical mind at once suggested great difficulty of
steering. Her sides, coarsely cut with an axe, were
from 3 to 5 in. thick; her bottom from 6 in. to 1 ft.
thick. The two extremities were solid blocks, so that
her weight&mdash;she was carved out of unusually heavy
wood&mdash;was altogether over 2,000 lb.</p>

<p>When I went down to the water to examine my
purchase I found that the vessel was in a pitiful condition
and needed sound repairing before she could
proceed on a long journey. She was sufficiently good
for crossing the stream&mdash;that was all she was used
for by the seringueiros&mdash;but it would be a different
matter to go down rapids for some thousands of kilometres.
It took all the strength of my men, the
seringueiros, and myself combined to pull the canoe
out of the water upon the beach and to turn her over.
We worked hard for two days with saws and hammers,
knives, tar and wadding, in order to stop up a gigantic
crack which extended from one end of the canoe to
the other under her bottom. Although the crack did
not go right through, I could well imagine that a
hard knock against a rock might be quite sufficient to
split the canoe in two. We scraped her and cleaned
her; we overhauled and strengthened her thoroughly;
we cut rough seats inside, and built an elevated deck
upon which the baggage might be comparatively safe
from moisture.</p>

<p>We were proud of our work when we launched her.
Wiping the dripping perspiration from our foreheads,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-3" id="Pg_2-3"></a>[<a href="images/2-3.png">3</a>]</span>
necks and arms, we looked just as if we had come
out of a bath, we sweated so in our efforts to push
her back into the water, the heat near the water,
screened as it was from the breeze by the high banks
and trees, being suffocating! We gazed at her&mdash;the
queen of the Arinos River. She looked lovely in our
eyes. On her stern I fixed the steering gear, a huge
paddle 12 ft. long; and upon a neatly-made staff,
which I had cut myself, I hoisted the British flag,
which had hitherto flown over my tent. It was, I
think, the first time the British flag had waved over
that river. The canoe was baptized the "Elfrida,"
after my sister's name.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that only four men remained
with me. Not one of them had ever been in
a canoe before&mdash;except to be ferried across a river,
perhaps&mdash;not one had the slightest idea of navigation,
and it followed, of course, that not one had ever used
a paddle or steered a canoe.</p>

<p>As the river had never been surveyed, it was my
intention to make an accurate map of its entire course as
far as its junction with the Tres Barras, several thousand
kils. away, from which point I imagined the river
must be slightly better known. Therefore, as I should
be busy all day long with the prismatic compass and
watch, constantly taking notes of the direction of the
stream and the distances covered (checked almost
daily by astronomical observations) I should not be
able to take an active part in the navigation.</p>

<p>The canoe was undermanned. Imagine her length&mdash;42
ft.&mdash;with only two men to paddle. A third man
was stationed on her bow to punt when possible and be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-4" id="Pg_2-4"></a>[<a href="images/2-4.png">4</a>]</span>
on the look-out for rocks; while Alcides, whom I had
promoted to the rank of quartermaster, was in charge
of the steering. I had taken the precaution to make
a number of extra paddles. We carried a large quantity
of fishing-lines with hooks of all sizes, and cartridges
of dynamite.</p>

<p>The river was most placid and beautiful, and the
water wonderfully clear. Unlike rivers elsewhere, the
Arinos did not show a branch or a twig floating on
its waters, not a leaf on its mirror-like surface. That
did not mean that branches of trees&mdash;sometimes even
whole trees&mdash;did not fall into the river, but, as I have
stated already, the specific gravity of woods in that
part of Brazil was so heavy that none floated. Hence
the ever-clean surface of all the streams.</p>

<p>We were then in a region of truly beautiful forest,
with <i>figueira</i> (<i>Ficus</i> of various kinds), trees of immense
size, and numerous large <i>cambar&aacute;</i>. The bark of the
latter&mdash;reddish in colour&mdash;when stewed in boiling
water, gave a refreshing decoction not unlike tea and
quite good to drink.</p>

<p>Most interesting of all the trees was, however, the
seringueira (<i>Siphonia elastica</i>), which was extraordinarily
plentiful in belts or zones along the courses
of rivers in that region. As is well known, the
seringueira, which grows wild in the forest there, is
one of the most valuable lactiferous plants in the world.
Its latex, properly coagulated, forms the best quality
of rubber known.</p>

<p>There are, of course, many latex-giving plants of
the <i>Euphorbi&aelig;</i>, <i>Artocarp&aelig;</i> and <i>Lobeli&aelig;</i> families, but no
other are perhaps such abundant givers of latex as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-5" id="Pg_2-5"></a>[<a href="images/2-5.png">5</a>]</span>
Brazilian seringueira (of the <i>Euphorbi&aelig;</i> family), a tree
plentiful not only in Matto Grosso on all the head-waters
and courses of the rivers flowing into the
Amazon, but also abundant in the Provinces of Para
and the Amazon. In less quantities the seringueira is
also to be found in Cear&aacute;, Rio Grande do Norte and
Maranh&atilde;o.</p>

<p>The seringueira prevailed chiefly near the water,
in swampy places, or in places inundated when the
river was high. Never was the tree to be found at a
distance away from water.</p>

<p>The height of the seringueira varies from 25 ft. to
50 ft. Its diameter is seldom more than 35 in. Its
leaf is composed of three elongated leaflets, smooth-edged
and complete in themselves. The seed is smooth-skinned,
and of a reddish tone. The fruit consists of
a well-rounded wooden capsule enclosing three cells
which contain white oily almonds not disagreeable to
eat. From the almonds an oil of a light red colour,
not unlike the colour of old port wine, can be extracted.
That oil can be substituted for linseed oil, and has the
further advantage of not desiccating so quickly. Mixed
with copal and turpentine it gives a handsome varnish.
It can be used advantageously in the manufacture of
printing-ink and soap. So that every part of the
seringueira can be put to some use or other.</p>

<p>Among the other more important trees which produce
rubber may be mentioned the <i>Siphonia brevifoglia</i>,
the <i>Siphonia brasiliensis</i>, <i>Siphonia rhytidocarpa</i>, and
the <i>Siphonia lutea</i>, all found chiefly in the State of
Para. In other parts of Brazil grow the <i>Ficus anthelmintica</i>,
the <i>Ficus doliaria</i> (or <i>gameilleira</i>), the <i>Ficus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-6" id="Pg_2-6"></a>[<a href="images/2-6.png">6</a>]</span>
elastica</i>, <i>Ficus indica</i>, <i>Ficus religiosa</i>, <i>Ficus radula</i>,
<i>Ficus elliptica</i>, <i>Ficus prinoides</i>, the <i>Plumeria phagedenica</i>,
the <i>Plumeria drastica</i>, the <i>Sorveira</i> or <i>Collophora
utilis</i>, and the <i>Mangabeira</i> or <i>Harncornia speciosa</i>.</p>

<p>At present we shall be chiefly interested in the
seringueira (<i>Siphonia elastica</i>).</p>

<p>The collection of the latex from the seringueira
and the subsequent process of coagulation were simple
enough. A seringueiro, or rubber-collector, started
from his hut early every morning carrying with him
a small steel axe or pick, the head of which was 3 in.
long and shaped like a bird's beak; a tin bucket, and
some <i>barro</i>&mdash;soft clay which had been soaked in water.
He walked along the <i>estrada</i> or track which he had
cleared for himself, leading from one rubber tree to
the next. There may be twenty, thirty, fifty or more
rubber trees that have been tapped on one estrada,
according to the district and the activity of the seringueiro.
In the case of a new tree a collar of the fibre
of burity palm was in the first instance nailed with
pegs of hard wood round the stem, not horizontally,
but at an angle: sometimes, when necessary, in a
spiral. In other cases a similar band of clay was
made to encircle the tree. These collars served as
channels, compelling the latex, as it exuded from cuts
made in the tree, to flow into a small tin cup suspended
at the lowest point of the collar. The incisions were
never made lower than 2 or 3 ft. from the ground.
They must not penetrate deeper than the entire thickness
of the bark of the tree, and they must on no
account touch or wound the actual wood, or the tree
would suffer greatly&mdash;even die. In some regions the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-7" id="Pg_2-7"></a>[<a href="images/2-7.png">7</a>]</span>
incisions were made longitudinally, in others transversely.
The operation was repeated by the seringueiro
each time on every rubber tree as he went along the
estrada, the latex flowing freely enough into the tin
cup after each fresh incision had been made.</p>

<p>The seringueiro thus tapped each tree on his way
out along the estrada, which in some cases may be
several miles long; in other cases, where rubber trees
were plentiful, only a few hundred yards in length. On
his return journey the seringueiro emptied each small
tin cup&mdash;by that time filled with latex&mdash;into the large
bucket which invariably accompanied him on his
daily round. Rubber-trees possess in a way at least
one characteristic of cows. The more milk or latex
one judiciously extracts from them, the more they give,
up to a certain point. But, indeed, such a thing is
known as exhausting a tree in a short time. A good
seringueiro usually gives the trees a rest from the
time they are in bloom until the fruit is mature. In
some regions even a much longer respite is given to
the trees&mdash;generally during the entire rainy season. In
some localities, too, in order to let the latex flow more
freely, a vertical incision is made above and meeting a
horizontal one. At intervals oblique incisions are cut
next to the vertical ones, but in Matto Grosso I never
saw that complicated system of incisions adopted&mdash;only
vertical incisions parallel to one another at a
distance of 0&middot;25 <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'c'">m</ins>. (9&#8542; in.) being made there, and in
rows one above another. Some of the trees had
actually hundreds of those cuts&mdash;many, of course,
healed. Each cut only exudes latex for a comparatively
short time, merely an hour or so.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-8" id="Pg_2-8"></a>[<a href="images/2-8.png">8</a>]</span>
During the first month after a tree is tapped, the
supply of latex is generally plentiful; the second month
it gives less; less still the third month. On an
average twenty trees give about one litre of latex a
day. Three litres of latex are necessary in order to
obtain one litre of rubber. At the head-waters of the
Arinos River 600 trees gave from 30 to 35 arobas (450
to 525 kils.) of fine rubber in the first month, and
about 20 arobas (300 kils.) of <i>sarnamb&eacute;</i> (second quality
with impurities). One aroba is 15 kils.</p>

<p>The latex of the seringueira in the Arinos region
was of a beautiful white, quite liquid, and with a
pungent, almost sickening, odour. When a new tree
was tapped, the lower towards the ground the incisions
were made the better. If after considerable tapping
the tree did not yield much, it was advisable to incise
the tree higher up. In that region the trees exuded
latex more abundantly when they began to have new
leaves in October. Late in the dry season the latex
flowed less freely. When the weather was windy all
the latex seemed to contract to the summit of the
trees and hardly flowed at all from the incisions. When
it rained, on the contrary, it flowed freely, but was
spoilt by being mixed with water; so that a good
seringueiro must know well not only where and how,
but also when to tap the trees, in order to get good
results.</p>

<p class="fsc">Method of Pressing Rubber into Cakes.</p>
<p class="figcenter">The alum process of coagulation being used.</p>
<hr />
<p>Several ways were employed in order to coagulate
the latex. The simplest was the one used in Matto
Grosso. The latex was poured into a rectangular
wooden mould, 0&middot;61 m. long (2 ft.), 0&middot;46 m. wide (1&frac12; ft.),
and 0&middot;15 m. deep (about 6 in.). Upon the latex was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-9" id="Pg_2-9"></a>[<a href="images/2-9.png">9</a>]</span>
placed a solution of alum and warm water. Then
coagulation took place. In order to compress the
coagulating latex into solid cakes, a primitive lever
arrangement was used&mdash;merely a heavy wooden bar,
one end of which was inserted into the cavity of a
tree, above the wooden mould, while at the other end
of the bar heavy logs of wood were suspended. One
night was sufficient for the latex to coagulate thoroughly
and be properly compressed into cakes, weighing each
about 22&frac12; kils. The cakes were lifted out by belts
of liane which had been previously laid into the
moulds.</p>

<p>The discoverer of the method of coagulating rubber
with alum was Henry S. Strauss. He also found that
by keeping the latex in hermetically sealed vessels it
could be preserved in a liquid state. The same result
could be obtained with ammonia.</p>

<p>In the Amazon and Para Provinces a different process
was used. The latex was coagulated by placing
it near the fire. The heat evaporated the aqueous part
and coagulated the vegetable albumen. In order to
make what was called a <i>garrafa</i>, or large ball of rubber&mdash;some
weighed 20, 30, 40 kils. and more&mdash;a small
ball of latex was made to coagulate round a horizontal
bar of wood. That ball was gradually increased in
circumference by smearing it over with more latex,
which became gradually coagulated and dried by the
heat and smoke produced by the burning of certain
woods, and of the oily seeds of the <i>urucuri</i> palm,
technically known as the <i>Attalea excelsa</i>. In this process
the rubber did not remain white, as with the alum
process; in fact, it became dark brown, almost black,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-10" id="Pg_2-10"></a>[<a href="images/2-10.png">10</a>]</span>
owing, of course, to the smoke. Locally, the smoking
process was said to be the better of the two, for the
coagulation with alum took away somewhat from the
elasticity of the rubber.</p>

<p>Interesting was the <i>sorveira</i> (<i>Collophora utilis</i>), a
tree which gave latex that was quite delicious to
drink, but could not be coagulated. The trees, to any
untrained person, closely resembled the seringueira,
only the leaves were more minute and differently shaped.
It must be remembered that nearly all the trees of the
Brazilian forest had leaves only at a very great height
above the ground, and it was not always easy to see
their shape, especially when close to other trees where
the foliage got interwoven into an almost solid mass.
We frequently enjoyed the sweet milk of the <i>sorveira</i>&mdash;it
tasted slightly of fresh walnuts with sugar on
them. It was unsafe to drink too much of it, as it had
injurious effects upon one's digestive organs.</p>

<p>There was there also the <i>leiteiro</i> (or producer of
milk), a smaller tree, and the liana <i>macaco</i>, which both
produced abundant milk, but in neither case had a
way, so far, been found to coagulate it.</p>

<p>The two days spent at Porto Velho were interesting.
The four men who had remained with me behaved
fairly well, principally owing to the prospect,
that, in drifting down stream, they would not have to
work, and would be saved the heavy trouble of grooming,
packing and unpacking the animals, and the
tedious job every morning of riding miles through the
country in order to recover those that had strayed
away during the night.</p>

<p>"Thank heaven!" exclaimed Antonio, as he gazed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-11" id="Pg_2-11"></a>[<a href="images/2-11.png">11</a>]</span>
at the canoe, "we shall not have to hunt for her every
morning!"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Filippe, "no more pack-saddles
to fix, no more leading the animals to drink. She"&mdash;pointing
to the canoe&mdash;"can drink all the time if she
likes...."</p>

<p>Filippe was a prophet. The canoe did "drink"
all the time, much to our concern. Little did my
men suspect before we started that they would have
the hardest time of their lives&mdash;so hard, indeed, that it
was amazing humans could endure it at all.</p>

<p>One of the three seringueiros at Porto Velho interested
me greatly. He was a tall, gentlemanly,
refined person, who seldom uttered a word. I noticed
that he avoided meeting me, and, although extremely
civil, seemed afraid to enter into conversation. The
little shed he had built himself (7 ft. by 4 ft., and
7 ft. high) was extraordinarily neat, and open on all
sides&mdash;quite unlike the sheds Brazilian rubber collectors
build themselves.</p>

<p>From my tent I watched him. The man got up
before sunrise every day, going at once to the river
for a swim. Humming some sort of a song, he would
then go through a series of gymnastic exercises, interrupted
by sonorous slaps upon different parts of his
anatomy to kill impertinent mosquitoes, of which there
were swarms on the Arinos River. That done, he would
assume a suit of working-clothes, and, returning to
his shed, would pick up his tools and noiselessly depart,
so as not to disturb our sleep! At sunset, when he
returned, he immediately proceeded to the river to
have another swim and to get rid of the many insects<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-12" id="Pg_2-12"></a>[<a href="images/2-12.png">12</a>]</span>
which always collected upon one's person in going
through the forest. Then he put on a clean suit of
clothes, and, saluting us from a distance, went to his
shed to rest.</p>

<p>I was certain the man was not a Brazilian, but as
curiosity is not one of my chief characteristics I took
no special notice of him. This brought him round
to my tent one evening. The man was a German by
birth, of a good family and excellent education. He
could speak German, English, French, Spanish and
Portuguese to perfection, and was well versed in
the literature of those languages. He had evidently
drifted about for many years in many parts of South
America in search of a fortune, in the Argentine, in
Uruguay, and had ended by becoming a slave in Brazil.
Yes, the poor old man was a voluntary slave. He
had borrowed from his employer and was unable to
repay. He was therefore a slave in the true sense
of the word, as his employer could, according to local
custom, sell him to any one he chose.</p>

<hr />
<p>I was terribly upset to see a European in such a
position, and, what was worse, I was not in a position
to help. Nor indeed was help asked for or wanted.
The old fellow bore the burden bravely, and said he
had never been happier in his life. Supposing he were
made to return to his own country&mdash;from which he had
been absent so many years&mdash;he philosophically argued,
what could he be, with no money and no friends, but
a most unhappy man? All his relatives and friends
must have died; the habits he had acquired in the
wilds were not suitable for European cities; he was
too old to change them. The German was an extra<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-13" id="Pg_2-13"></a>[<a href="images/2-13.png">13</a>]</span>ordinarily
fine type of a man, honest, straightforward,
brave. He spoke in the kindest and fairest way of
his master. He had sold himself because of necessity.
It was now a matter of honour, and he would remain
a slave until it was possible to repay the purchase
money&mdash;some four hundred pounds sterling, if I remember
rightly&mdash;which he never expected to be able
to repay at all.</p>

<p>The German told me some interesting things about
the immediate neighbourhood of the camp. The
Indians of the Cayapo tribe, who lived close by, did
not interfere with the seringueiros. He had been there
several years in succession, and he had never seen an
Indian. The seringueiros only went to collect rubber
during some three or four months each year, after
which time they returned to the distant towns south
as far as Cuyab&aacute; and Corumb&aacute;. At the beginning of
the rainy season, when the time came for them to
retire, the Indians generally began to remind the
seringueiros that it was time to go, by placing obstacles
on the estrada, by removing cups or even the collars
from the rubber trees. But so far in that region, although
footmarks of Indians and other signs of them
had been noticed, not one individual had been actually
seen. Their voices were frequently heard in the distance
singing war songs.</p>

<p>"Hark!" said the German to me, "do you hear
them?"</p>

<p>I listened attentively. Far, far down the river a
faint chorus of voices could just be heard&mdash;intermittent
sounds of "hu&aacute; ... hu&aacute; ... hu&aacute; ... hu&aacute;."
In the stillness of the night the sound could be dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-14" id="Pg_2-14"></a>[<a href="images/2-14.png">14</a>]</span>tinguished
clearly. It went on until sunrise, when it
gradually died out.</p>

<p>There was a big lagoon to the west of Porto Velho,
formed by the river at high water. The lagoon dried
up during the dry season. It was separated from the
river only by a narrow tongue of land, 80 ft. high.</p>

<p>I took careful and repeated observations for latitude,
longitude, and altitude, the latter by a boiling-point
thermometer, from our point of departure at the
headwaters of the Arinos River. The elevation of the
river was there 1,200 ft. by aneroid, 1,271 ft. by
the hypsometrical apparatus. The latitude was 14&deg;
2&#8242;&middot;2 South; the longitude 56&deg; 17&#8242; West of Greenwich.</p>

<p>We were having beautiful, clear skies. Only on
July 4th at sunset a solitary streak of mist extended
to the summit of the sky.</p>

<p>I had two plans in my mind when I decided to
descend the Arinos River. One was to abandon that
river at the point where it met the <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Jurnena'">Juruena</ins> River and
strike across country westward until the Madeira-Mamore
Railway was met. The other plan&mdash;even
more difficult&mdash;was to continue down the river as far
as its junction with the Tres Barras, from which place
I would strike across the virgin forest as far as the
Madeira River. I had not the faintest idea how I
could realize either plan with the ridiculously meagre
resources at my disposal. I had money enough, but
unfortunately that was one of the few spots on earth
where money was of little use. Again I trusted in
Providence to come to our help. Both plans involved
thousands of kilometres of navigation of a diabolical
river, in an almost uncontrollable canoe, with an in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-15" id="Pg_2-15"></a>[<a href="images/2-15.png">15</a>]</span>sufficient
and absolutely incapable crew. Then would
come the crossing of the virgin forest on foot, for some
hundreds of kilometres&mdash;nobody knew how many. The
least number of men necessary in order to be able to
carry provisions sufficient to execute either plan was
thirty. I only had four. Yet I started. The second
plan was successfully carried out, but necessarily at
the cost almost of all our lives, and with sufferings
unimaginable.</p>

<h2><a name="II_CHAPTER_II" id="II_CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Hoisting the British Flag&mdash;An Escaped Slave&mdash;A Dilemma&mdash;Benedicto&mdash;The
<i>Lutra Brasiliensis</i>&mdash;The Seringueiros&mdash;A Marvellous River&mdash;Rapids</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> July 6th we packed the canoe with our baggage
and dogs. The British flag was hoisted at the stern
of the canoe, and with tender embraces from the
seringueiros, whose eyes were wet with tears&mdash;they
imagined that we were going to certain death&mdash;we
pulled out of Porto Velho at seven minutes to eleven
o'clock a.m.</p>

<p>"We will pray with all our hearts that you may
reach the end of your journey safely!... Beware
of the rapids; they are terrible.... Be careful because
the canoe does not steer true.... Do not let the
canoe knock too hard against rocks, or she may split
in two!... Good-bye!... good-bye!"</p>

<p>With those encouraging remarks from the seringueiros,
who were sobbing bitterly, we drifted with the
current, Antonio and Filippe the negro paddling in
the style generally adopted for scooping soup with a
spoon out of a dish.</p>

<p>I had provided the canoe with a number of improvised
paddles we had cut ourselves. There were no
two of equal size, shape, or weight. We had chopped
them with an axe from sections of a tree. They were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-17" id="Pg_2-17"></a>[<a href="images/2-17.png">17</a>]</span>
originally all intended to be the same, but what we
intended to have and what we got were two different
matters, as the five of us each worked on a separate
paddle.</p>

<p>The seringueiros stood on the high bank, waving
their arms in the air. One of them blew plaintive
sounds on one of the horns used by them for calling
their companions while in the forest. Those horns
could be heard enormous distances. Filippe the white
man, who was not paddling, fired back a salute of ten
shots. There was nothing my men loved more than
to waste ammunition. Fortunately we had plenty.</p>

<p>The average width of the river was there from 80
to 100 metres, with a fairly swift current. It was lucky
that ours was the only boat on that river, for indeed
we needed all that breadth of water in our snake-like
navigation. I remonstrated with Alcides, who was at
the helm, and advised him to keep the nose of the
canoe straight ahead, as we were coming to a <i>corrideira</i>
or small rapid.</p>

<p>Alcides, who could never be told anything, became
enraged at my words of warning, and also at the
derision of the other men, as we were drifting side on
and he could not straighten her course. Just as we
were entering the rapid, in his fury Alcides, in disgust,
let go the steering-gear, which he said was useless.
We were seized by the current and swung round with
some violence, dashing along, scraping the bottom of
the canoe on rocks, and bumping now on one side,
now on the other, until eventually we were dashed
violently over a lot of submerged trees, where the
bank had been eroded by the current and there had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-18" id="Pg_2-18"></a>[<a href="images/2-18.png">18</a>]</span>
been a landslide. The canoe nearly capsized, the three
dogs and some top baggage being thrown out into the
water by the impact. We got stuck so hard among
the branches of the trees that we all had to remove
our lower garments and get into the water trying to
get the canoe off.</p>

<p>My men used pretty language. That small accident
was lucky for us. The shouts of my men attracted
to the bank a passing man. Half-scared, a
wild figure of a mulatto with long, unkempt hair and
beard, his body covered by what must have once been
a suit of clothes, stood gazing at us, clutching a double-barrelled
gun in his hands.</p>

<p>"Is there a revolution in Matto Grosso?" he
inquired when I caught sight of him. "Why do you
fly the red flag?"</p>

<p>"That is not the flag of revolution, that is the flag
of peace. It is the English flag."</p>

<p>"The English flag! The English flag!" he exclaimed,
running down the slope of the river bank.
"You are English!... Oh, sir, take me with you!
I entreat you take me with you! I am an escaped
slave.... I owe my master much money.... I can
never repay it.... I am a seringueiro. My estrada
is some miles down the river. I have been there alone
suffering for months. I had no more food, nothing.
There is very little fish in the river. The life is too
terrible. I can stand it no more. If you do not take
me with you I shall kill myself."</p>

<p>I tried to persuade the strange figure to return to
his master&mdash;the master lived in comfort in the city
of Cuyab&aacute;. "If you chose to borrow money and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-19" id="Pg_2-19"></a>[<a href="images/2-19.png">19</a>]</span>
sell yourself, it was only right that you should repay
your debt." That was the only way I could look at it.
But the man would not hear of it. If I did not
take him he would kill himself&mdash;there, before me, he
repeated; that was all.</p>

<p>So difficult a dilemma to solve&mdash;at so inconvenient
a moment, when we were as busy as busy could be,
trying to disentangle the canoe&mdash;was rather tiresome.
The strange man, having laid his gun upon the ground,
helped us with all his might in our work. When the
canoe got off, the strange man, gun and all, jumped
clumsily into her and nearly capsized her a second
time. He implored me with tears in his eyes to take
him along. He would work day and night; he would
present me with his double-barrelled gun (an old
muzzle-loader); he did not want pay&mdash;he only wanted
to get freed from his master, who, he said, robbed and
ill-treated him.</p>

<p>"Do you swear upon all that is most sacred that
you have made up your mind not to go back to your
master?"</p>

<p>"Yes. If you say 'No' to me, I shall kill myself now."</p>

<p>Benedicto&mdash;that was his name&mdash;spoke with quiet
determination.</p>

<p>"Very good, Benedicto. You can remain. What
is more, you shall receive from this moment the same
pay as the other men. You can keep your old gun,
too."</p>

<p>Benedicto embraced and kissed my hands, then
my feet. The poor man's joy was so great that it was
really worth living to see that such moments of happiness
could be procured in a man's lifetime.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-20" id="Pg_2-20"></a>[<a href="images/2-20.png">20</a>]</span>
Benedicto was a free man again, and for the first
time in his life was earning genuine money! He was
handed a paddle, and he paddled away for all he was
worth, splashing with water those in front and behind
him. He was in a state of great excitement, tears
flowing freely down his cheeks and beard, and dripping
on to his knees as he sat in the bottom of the
canoe. He sobbed to his heart's content, and kept
on splashing us all over with his paddle. We were all
so touched by that pathetic scene that we preferred
getting wet to remonstrating.</p>

<p>Fortunately the river was placid enough under the
<i>corrideira</i>. When things had quieted down a little, I
taught Benedicto and the others how to paddle properly,
and Alcides how to steer straight. I had then
five men. That improved matters greatly, as four
could paddle while the fifth was steering.</p>

<p>The Arinos River flowed from Porto Velho in a
south-westerly, then in a due westerly direction, then
north, then again west, from which last point it doubled,
as it were, and proceeded east and south-east, returning
to within quite a short distance of our original
point of departure. We sounded our horn, and immediately
heard in reply the horn of the seringueiros
at Porto Velho. Judging by the sound, the distance
could not have been more than a few hundred metres,
although we had travelled some six thousand metres
down stream.</p>

<hr />
<p>For the first time I noticed swallows flying swiftly
over the river, close to the water. Another easy
<i>corrideira</i> was encountered. When we had been out
several hours my men were already beginning to get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-21" id="Pg_2-21"></a>[<a href="images/2-21.png">21</a>]</span>
into the right way of paddling, and Alcides was commencing
to understand the capricious mysteries of the
steering-gear.</p>

<p>On account of my men's inexperience&mdash;and due
credit being given to the current&mdash;we went at the rate
of 13 kils. an hour. Innumerable were the rubber
trees all along the banks. Occasionally small sand
beaches were met with. Here and there a fallen giant
tree obstructed part of the river. Families of <i>ariranhas</i>
(<i>Lutra brasiliensis</i>) played in the water. The pretty
little animals&mdash;not unlike otters&mdash;raised their heads
above water, and, hissing loudly, frequently came to
attack the canoe. They were extraordinarily brave.
They were greatly attracted by the vivid red of the
British flag, which in their imagination suggested
blood. They became wildly excited when I waved the
flag at them, and when I placed it near the water they
would charge the canoe&mdash;so much so that two or
three times my men were able to kill them by striking
them on the head with the heavy wooden paddles.</p>

<p>The river was at its lowest when I descended it,
which made it all the more difficult for us, as we were
treated to innumerable small rapids which would otherwise
have been entirely covered over with water. A
great island (80 m. long) of pebbles and beautiful
crystals was passed in the centre of the stream, which
there formed two channels; one entirely blocked by
fallen trees and accumulated rolling material, the other,
40 m. wide, very deep and swift.</p>

<p>The banks of the river were about 20 ft. high,
generally of red earth, with a stratum of white sand
above. The vegetation was luxuriant and extra<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-22" id="Pg_2-22"></a>[<a href="images/2-22.png">22</a>]</span>ordinarily
tidy along the summit of the banks. The
water was quite crystal-like, it was so clear. All the
time our nostrils were fully expanded to inhale the
delicious scent of the forest, which closely resembled
that of jessamine. Masses of violet-coloured convolvuli
were festooned from the trees. That was a great
treat for me, after the months I had gone through
when my entire days were spent eating up dust raised
in clouds by the troop of animals marching in front
of me.</p>

<p>When you came to survey a river it was really
amazing what zigzags water could make in cutting its
way through a country. From north-west the Arinos
veered south-west, and from south-west to north-east.</p>

<p>By one o'clock we were in a spacious basin, 200 m.
in diameter, close to which a small tributary, 2 m.
wide, entered the Arinos on the left bank. Farther
down on the right bank were neat beaches of white
and red sand. We stopped for a few moments at a
seringueiro's shed. The poor fellow&mdash;a negro&mdash;was in
a pitiable condition from malarial fever.</p>

<p>Those martyrs of labour were much to be pitied,
and also admired. There, hundreds of miles away
from everybody, they stayed, abandoned in the forest
until the agents of their masters who had dropped
them there found it convenient to come and fetch
them back again. If they came back at all and never
failed, it was not, you can be sure, for the interest
they took in human life, but because of the quantity
of valuable rubber which they expected would be collected
before their return. Those poor creatures had
no possible way of escape, except under extraordinary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-23" id="Pg_2-23"></a>[<a href="images/2-23.png">23</a>]</span>
circumstances. They were conveyed to their stations
overland by means of pack animals, which at once
were sent back and did not return until the end of the
collecting season. Even then, if the seringueiro wanted
to get away, he was frequently compelled to purchase
an animal from his employer at three or four times
its actual value&mdash;that is to say, perhaps sixty or
eighty pounds sterling. So that the more a man
worked or earned the more he became indebted to his
master.</p>

<p>Like all men who have lived a great deal in exile
and solitude, the seringueiros&mdash;nearly all blacks or
mulattos&mdash;were extraordinarily generous. They always
wanted to give you all they possessed&mdash;which was next
to nothing, but meant a fortune to them. They would
deprive themselves of anything if they thought they
could give the slightest pleasure.</p>

<p>We left the seringueiro. I feared the poor man
could not live long in his broken-down condition. He
was most grateful for some medicine and provisions I
left with him. His farewell to us was in so melancholy
a voice, as he tried to lift himself out of an improvised
bamboo couch, that for days it rang in my ears, and
before my eyes constantly remained his skeleton-like,
sunken features as he waved his farewell and fell
back exhausted.</p>

<p>Behind a narrow barrier of sand, about 10 ft. high,
as we proceeded down stream in a north-westerly
direction, was a large lagoon.</p>

<p>The river was really too beautiful for words, the
clear green water reflecting with precision in deeper
tones the view before us. Only when its course was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-24" id="Pg_2-24"></a>[<a href="images/2-24.png">24</a>]</span>
disturbed and diverted by a sharp rock or by the
branches of a fallen and dying tree, the successive
angular ridges of the troubled water shone like polished
silver in parallel lines from the reflected light of the
sun, just like a huge luminous skeleton of a fish.</p>

<p>The trees were truly wonderful along the river&mdash;tall
and healthy, with dense deep green foliage. But
Nature seemed absolutely asleep. Barring the few
swallows we had seen soon after our departure, and
the <i>ariranhas</i>, we went the whole day without hearing
the song of a bird, or the howling of a wild animal.
We did hear a noise resembling the bark of a dog&mdash;so
much did it resemble it that my dogs barked back.
But it came not from a dog at all. The peculiar noise
was made by a large bird.</p>

<p>After passing a handsome beach of white sand on
our left, the river described sharp angles, west, north-west,
north-east, then north. There were rapids, fairly
strong, although not dangerous in any way. The river
was forced through a channel 50 m. wide, in which
the current was very strong. To make things worse,
a giant tree had fallen and obstructed much of the
passage, compelling us to negotiate the rapid in its
worst part. A large bay, 180 m. in diameter, opened
out below that point. Farther came a perfectly
straight stretch of water for 3,000 m. Halfway down
that stretch, to the right, we passed the mouth of the
Agua Clara, a charming rivulet of crystalline water,
10 m. wide. A conglomerate stratum of alluvial
formation, composed of well-rounded pebbles held together
by red earth, and crumbling easily under pressure
of the fingers, showed through in many places.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-25" id="Pg_2-25"></a>[<a href="images/2-25.png">25</a>]</span>
The beaches of handsome, fine white sand were most
interesting.</p>

<p>The forest was getting thin on both sides. In fact,
late in the afternoon we had open country on the
left bank&mdash;only a few trees being visible near the
water's edge, and an occasional giant <i>jatob&aacute;</i> (<i>Hymencoea
Courbaril</i> L.), the latter chiefly on the right bank.
The right bank was sparsely wooded, and at one time
we had open campos on both sides of us.</p>

<p>A streamlet 3 m. wide entered the Arinos on the
left. We got to one point where the river proved
treacherous, although apparently almost tranquil on
the surface. The Brazilians have an excellent name
for such places&mdash;<i>rebojo</i>, or a curve formed by sudden
deviation of a current. If we had not been careful
in going across such places, it would have been easy
for the canoe to have been turned over and sucked
under.</p>

<p>Patches of thick forest were met on either bank,
and in those patches numerous indeed were the rubber
trees. In the afternoon we saw chiefly campos and
<i>chapada</i>, or thin scrub.</p>

<p>Considering all, we did well&mdash;chiefly owing to the
strong current&mdash;on our first day of navigation. We
had gone some 70 kils. when we halted at sunset, at
the junction of the very deep streamlet Quarustera
with the Arinos. The elevation of our camp, 60 ft.
above the river, was 1,200 ft.</p>

<p>The nights were cool enough&mdash;minimum 55&deg; Fahr.
on the night of June 6th&mdash;7th. There was a thick haze
over the river in the morning, and as we did not
know what we might be coming upon suddenly we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-26" id="Pg_2-26"></a>[<a href="images/2-26.png">26</a>]</span>
did not make a start until 7.15. After crossing a
large and shallow bay the stream was forced into a
channel 50 m. wide. There was open country&mdash;campos&mdash;on
the right bank. A curious isolated volcanic
boulder split in two was then observed in the stream,
while the banks were of alluvially deposited conglomerate.
From that spot luxuriant forest was on the
right bank once more, while open country was on
the left. Upon examination I found that the thick
forest was merely a band or zone near the water&mdash;behind
was open country.</p>

<p>Farther, the river went through a neck 40 m. wide
where the current was very swift. The banks almost
all along were from 10 to 20 ft. high. Slender <i>tucuma</i>
or <i>tucuman</i> palms were to be seen, which had stems only
3 to 4 in. in diameter, but were 30 to 40 ft. high,
and had a ball-like tuft of leaves at the top. We then
came upon open country (<i>chapada</i>) on both sides,
and went over small <i>corrideiras</i>, which we got to like,
as we travelled along on them at a greater speed than
in the still waters, with a minimum of exertion. The
river seemed to be getting narrower all the time that
day, and, of course, deeper. In many spots it went
through a channel not more than 30 m. wide.</p>

<p>We heard&mdash;but not for long&mdash;the cackling of the
<i>jacu</i> (<i>Penelope cristata</i>), a handsome gallinaceous bird.
The <i>jacu</i> made most delicious eating. Then that day
flocks of small green parrots flew over our heads on
several occasions.</p>

<p><i>Ariranhas</i> gave us once more a good deal of amusement
and sport. It was seldom one found such
cheeky and inquisitive animals. They would pop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-27" id="Pg_2-27"></a>[<a href="images/2-27.png">27</a>]</span>
their heads out of the water quite close to the canoe and
sniff and grind their teeth at us. They had beautiful
little heads&mdash;something between a cat and a seal&mdash;with
lovely, but wicked, black eyes of wonderful
luminosity. They had a perfect craving for blood.
The Brazilians have strange tales about them&mdash;not
exactly fit for publication.</p>

<p>The sand beaches were not so frequent as we
advanced on our journey. We noticed instead extensive
beaches of gravel. Another tributary stream,
10 m. wide at its mouth, entered the Arinos from the
east. There was heavy forest there with plenty of
rubber-trees on the right bank, whereas the country
was open on the left bank.</p>

<p>Farther down, the banks became low, so that
the slightest rise in the river would inundate the
country. The forest was particularly thick, and the
rubber trees plentiful, along a stretch of 4,300 m. of
river in a perfectly straight line.</p>

<p>The river was getting more and more beautiful at
every turn. We emerged into a bay 300 m. in diameter.
Great blocks of conglomerate were strewn
about. A great spur projected to the centre of
the bay. The richness in rubber of that region was
amazing. Wonderful giant trees, heavily laden with
dark green foliage, were reflected in deeper tones in the
water of the river&mdash;there almost stagnant because
held up by some obstacle lower down. Innumerable
festoons of creepers hung down from those trees. The
stream was there 80 m. wide, and beautiful that day
in great stretches of 4,300 m., 1,400 m., 1,000 m.,
3,000 m., 1,500 m., and 1,200 m.&mdash;in a perfectly straight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-28" id="Pg_2-28"></a>[<a href="images/2-28.png">28</a>]</span>
line. The forest was occasionally interrupted on one
side or the other by great expanses of <i>chapada</i>.</p>

<p>Immense <i>bacabeira</i> palms, 40 to 50 ft. high, were
numerous, most graceful to look at, with their ten or
eleven huge compound leaves placed like an open fan.
Yellow filaments of some length hung in a cluster
where the petiole of the leaves met.</p>

<p>We arrived at a <i>pedreria</i>&mdash;an accumulation of rocks&mdash;extending
almost right across the stream, and which
was the cause of the placidity of the waters above it.
There were two channels&mdash;one to bearings magnetic
330&deg;, the other to 360&deg;&mdash;on either side of a central
island. We followed the first and larger channel. The
island, which had a most luxuriant growth of trees
upon it, was subdivided into two by a channel 10 m.
wide at its south-eastern end.</p>

<p>For purposes of identification I named all the
islands we saw. The larger of these two I called
Esmeralda Island. In order to establish its exact
position I landed and took observations for latitude
and longitude. Lat. 13&deg; 15&#8242;&middot;6 S.; long. 56&deg; 46&#8242; W.</p>

<p class="fsc">Vegetation on an Island in the River Arinos.</p>

<p>We were then at an elevation of 1,150 ft. The
temperature in the shade was 77&deg; Fahr. and 98&deg; in
the sun. Six-tenths of the sky was covered with
thick globular clouds, which made the air heavy,
although the temperature was not excessively high.
It must be remembered that we in the canoe were
in the sun all the time and suffered a good deal in
the morning and afternoon, when the sun was not
high, by the refraction of the sun's rays from the
water. The refracted light was so powerful that it
interfered a good deal with the navigation. The river<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-29" id="Pg_2-29"></a>[<a href="images/2-29.png">29</a>]</span>
looked like a molten surface of boiling silver, which
absolutely blinded us at times, and made it impossible
to see what was ahead in the water.</p>

<p>Esmeralda Island was formerly joined at its most
south-westerly point to the western bank of the
river. From that point the river described an arc of a
circle as far as bearings magnetic 20&deg; (N.N.E.). We
negotiated successfully two small rapids with large
volcanic rocks just under the surface of the water. We
just escaped going over one of them, which would
have certainly capsized the canoe. As it was we
merely scraped the side of the canoe against it.</p>

<p>The left bank, which had crumbled down, showed
strata of conglomerate and yellow sand, with upper
alluvial deposits of a light grey colour.</p>

<p>We were travelling due north in a straight line
of 1,800 m. when we came upon the entrance of a lakelet
on the west side of an islet. A huge fish&mdash;some
5 ft. in length&mdash;unaccustomed to the unusual sight of
human beings, played about under our canoe for some
time, much to the excitement of my men. Birds
of superb metallic blue, vivid yellow, and iridescent
plumage played about among the trees. On the left
bank farther down was a great growth of high bamboos,
then again forest with plenty of vigorous rubber trees.</p>

<p>Again small and fairly swift rapids were encountered
in a turn of the river from bearings magnetic
70&deg; to 250&deg;. A tributary stream which came from
the south entered the Arinos on its left bank.
Then we came to another island forming two
channels&mdash;one (N.W.) 20 m. wide, with some rough-looking
rapids; the other channel (N.), larger and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-30" id="Pg_2-30"></a>[<a href="images/2-30.png">30</a>]</span>
shallower, divided in its turn in two by a mound
of yellow gravel.</p>

<p>Alcides, who steered, had an idea that in going
down rapids you should always send the canoe over
places where the water broke and foamed, which meant
rocks underneath, and not keep her in the centre of
the channel where the water was deeper. This idea
was, I think, suggested by his inability to swim, and
the hope that if we got wrecked he could touch bottom
with his feet, so that his life might be in comparative
safety. I tried to argue the point with him, but it
was no use. It invariably led to such unpleasantness
that once more I decided to trust in Providence, as
long as we went forward.</p>

<p>I had just shouted to Alcides to keep in the centre
of the channel. Of course he disobeyed. We were
caught in the strong current. One moment later there
was a violent bump which knocked us all off our seats
and sent us sprawling in the bottom of the canoe.
We had stuck fast between two rocks. The canoe,
being of such great length, vibrated to and fro with the
current forcing it at the side. Laden as she was with
baggage, in a few moments she became filled with
water, and it was only after working hard for the best
part of an hour that we were able to extricate ourselves
from our position. We had hardly finished
baling the water out on resuming our course than,
1,500 m. farther, we came to more rapids, then 700 m.
beyond yet other rapids.</p>

<p>The forest was fairly thick all along on both banks,
with innumerable healthy rubber trees. Although the
forest seemed impenetrable at first sight, I always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-31" id="Pg_2-31"></a>[<a href="images/2-31.png">31</a>]</span>
found that it was easy enough to go through it if one
knew how. Quite close to the water naturally the
vegetation was somewhat entangled. In many places
were extensive patches of bamboos of considerable
height; but there is a way of disentangling the
most confused growth, if you happen to understand
how those plants and liane grow and get twisted.
Any one with a keen sense of observation should experience
no difficulty whatever in going through the
densest forest anywhere in the world&mdash;even without
using a knife&mdash;although, of course, the latter is useful
when you wish to keep up a certain speed in your
marching.</p>

<p>Eleven kilometres and a half from the last rapids&mdash;having
travelled north-west, south-west, east, and
even due south, so winding was the course of the river&mdash;we
came to a tributary stream 10 m. wide, on the
left side of the Arinos. Eight kilometres farther we
passed the inlet&mdash;then dry&mdash;of a small lagoon fed by
the stream. The river banks, where eroded by the
water, showed a lower layer of reddish-brown rock with
a bright red ferruginous stratum above it. The top
layer, 10 ft. thick, seemed formed of lime and alluvial
deposits.</p>

<p>We emerged into a large basin 200 m. across, with
a charming little island in the centre forming two
channels with fairly strong rapids. We followed the
channel on the right. At that point the river folded
over itself into a great elbow. A cliff, 120 ft. high,
towered on one side in brilliant red and yellow. The
lower half of the strata was perfectly horizontal; the
upper half at an angle of 45&deg; to the lower. The vivid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-32" id="Pg_2-32"></a>[<a href="images/2-32.png">32</a>]</span>
colouring was intensified by contrast with a beautiful
beach of immaculate white sand on the left side of the
great elbow.</p>

<p>I observed a wonderful double lunar halo on the
night of July 7-8, the outer circle in successive tints
of most delicate yellow, orange, pale blue and white&mdash;the
yellow being nearest the centre.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> were rather proud of ourselves, as we had gone
69 kils. on July 7th, paddling away&mdash;barring the interval
for lunch&mdash;from 7.15 in the morning until 7.30
at night.</p>

<p>The night was fairly cold&mdash;minimum 57&deg; Fahr.;
the elevation 1,100 ft. Where I made camp at the
elbow of the stream (on the left bank) there were innumerable
rubber trees. A similar wealth of <i>Siphonia
elastica</i> appeared to be on the opposite bank, where the
forest was luxuriant.</p>

<p>On July 8th we began our journey by going down
rapids. Then after some 15,300 m. of fairly smooth
navigation we crossed a basin 130 m. wide, where we
encountered strong eddies&mdash;most unpleasant, as they
swerved the canoe about in a way that was alarming.
Lower down a swift <i>corrideira</i> and more eddies gave
us some trouble.</p>

<p>A beautiful <i>ariranha</i> peeped out of the water close
to the canoe, spitting angrily at us. It was attracted
by the blood-red of the English flag, which it evidently
wanted to bite. My men fired and wounded it; but
so vicious were those little otters, and so great their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-34" id="Pg_2-34"></a>[<a href="images/2-34.png">34</a>]</span>
craving for blood, that it still came on to within a
foot or two of the canoe, when my men killed it.</p>

<p>The river was there compressed into a deep channel,
85 m. wide, with a strong current, after which it split
into two arms&mdash;one north-west, 25 m. wide; the other
north-east, 30 m. broad. The island thus formed between
the two arms was 2,500 m. long. We called it
Ariranha Island.</p>

<p>A streamlet 3 m. wide entered the Arinos on the
right bank. Where the banks were free from vegetation
an undulating stratum of red earth was exposed,
directly above which was a stratum from 1 to 2 ft.
thick of a brilliant yellow colour. Above that rested
the usual grey alluvial deposits from 6 to 8 ft. thick.</p>

<p>From a direction due west the stream suddenly
turned north, between high banks. A strong <i>corrideira</i>
was found before the stream divided itself into
three arms&mdash;two of those arms flowing north-east, the
other north-west. We followed the latter&mdash;a channel
20 m. wide, with a high bank of gravel on its left side.
Where those arms met again&mdash;some 500 m. farther&mdash;a
basin 200 m. in diameter was formed. A hill 150 ft.
high, covered with dense vegetation, faced us to the
north. It was quite an unusual sight in such flat
country. The stream took a sharp turn at that spot&mdash;it
positively doubled. Strong eddies were encountered.
The greatest care should have been taken in
going over places of that kind, but "care" was a
word I had absolutely scratched out of my vocabulary
as useless in my journey across Brazil. How and why
we ever got across those places with the crew I had
on board, would indeed be beyond me to explain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-35" id="Pg_2-35"></a>[<a href="images/2-35.png">35</a>]</span>&mdash;unless,
as on preceding occasions, it was due to the
unceasing protection of a guardian angel.</p>

<p>After crossing a circular basin 200 m. in diameter,
the river became suddenly squeezed into a channel
30 m. wide, much strewn with rocks. A somewhat
troublesome rapid had to be negotiated there, rendered
more difficult by the recent fall, across the best part
of the stream, of a giant tree. The branches which
stuck out of the water formed a regular barrier and
waved to and fro with the violent pressure of the
water. Before we could realize where we were, Alcides
steered us straight into the branches and foliage of the
fallen tree. As we were travelling at an accelerated
speed with the strong current, all our hats were scraped
off our heads, and, what was worse, our scalps, faces,
and arms had patches of skin torn off as we crashed
among the branches. It took us some time before we
were able to disentangle ourselves, resume navigation,
and recover as we went along the various headgear
floating independently down the stream.</p>

<p>Another little tributary, 2 m. wide, entered the
Arinos on the left side. No sooner had we freed ourselves
from the rapids than we were in a circle 80 m.
across, with nasty-looking eddies, which swung the
undermanned canoe now to one side, then violently
to the other, in a dangerous way. We could not have
struck a worse time for navigating the river. It was
then the end of the dry season and the water at its
lowest, so that every possible obstacle that could be
found in that river stood to impede our progress. This
would not have been the case at high water when
navigation in that portion of the stream would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-36" id="Pg_2-36"></a>[<a href="images/2-36.png">36</a>]</span>
been comparatively smooth and easy. We were thanking
our stars that we had passed the vicious eddies
safely, when we were confronted by more rapids,
with treacherous submerged rocks. Yet another basin,
150 m. wide, was crossed, with large blocks of black
rock showing through on the left bank. More rapids
were met&mdash;quite easy to negotiate. The sky was half
covered with feathery radiations from the south.</p>

<p>To the north another hill, 120 ft. high, eroded by
water, stood on the left bank of the stream, where red
volcanic rock was also visible in a stratum 15 ft. thick,
covered by a thick layer of yellow earth. Strong rapids
came next. We had had so much luck in the descent
of the rapids&mdash;which, bad as they were, really were so
far quite unimportant as compared to what we were
to find later&mdash;that my men began to be quite adventurous.
Saving trifling mishaps, we were getting
on well. The tributaries of the Arinos we had seen so
far that day were small streamlets 1 m. wide on the
right; another, 2 m. wide&mdash;a limpid stream&mdash;coming
from the south-west on the left. Several springs of
clear water filtered through the left bank. In the
centre of the river was an extensive bank of gravel
held up by blocks of volcanic rock.</p>

<p>In a basin 150 m. wide rose a pretty island. Rapids
were found in the channels, of which the western was
wider and more free from obstacles. For one entire
kilometre there were strong eddies and rapids in succession;
then came 3,500 m. of fairly easy travelling.
The river for 23,500 m. had been flowing almost in a
straight line due north, with slight variations of a few
degrees to the north-east and once to the north-west.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-37" id="Pg_2-37"></a>[<a href="images/2-37.png">37</a>]</span>
Plenty of <i>tucum</i> or <i>tucuma</i> palms adorned the right
bank; whereas on the left bank was fairly open
country.</p>

<p>Again, after some more rapids, the river was
squeezed into a neck only 25 m. wide, gradually widening
to some 150 m., where whirlpools and eddies of
considerable magnitude were formed. On several
occasions the canoe was caught in them and swerved
right round, describing one or more circles upon herself.
Two islets were passed, then a tributary 10 m.
wide coming from the east on the right side of us.</p>

<p>A great number of submerged rocks close to the
surface formed a ridge 200 m. in length all along the
centre of the stream. In a wonderful stretch 4,000 m.
long in a perfectly straight line north, the river was
from 50 to 100 m. wide. A small tributary rivulet
entered it on the west. At the end of that long stretch
a wall, 100 ft. high, of brilliantly yellow rock in its
lower part, with 15 ft. of vivid red rock above, diverted
the stream almost at a right angle toward the west.
Rapids and eddies were encountered after passing an
obstruction of accumulated gravel in the centre of the
river, there 50 m. wide.</p>

<p>Giant trees, not unlike weeping willows, bent over
the river, their streamers touching the water. A rocky
barrier extended as far as the centre of the stream,
leaving only one safe passage on the left side close to
the bank. The stream was at that point 100 m.
broad, and of great beauty, in a straight line north for
7,400 m.</p>

<p>My men were beginning to paddle a little better,
and we were travelling at a considerable speed with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-38" id="Pg_2-38"></a>[<a href="images/2-38.png">38</a>]</span>
the current. We had glorious weather, and although
the heat was great our travelling was perfectly delightful.
In the daytime we were not worried much by
insects. The canoe now and then stuck fast in shallow
places or upon rocks, but we all jumped gaily into
the water and pushed her along until she floated again.
Those baths in the deliciously clear water were quite
refreshing. We generally jumped in clothes and all,
and left it to the sun to dry the garments upon our
backs and legs. I usually wore pyjamas while travelling
in the canoe, as they were more comfortable than
other clothes and dried quicker when we came out of
the water again.</p>

<p>Many sharp successive turns were met next in the
course of the river, which then showed stunted vegetation
on the right bank and thick forest on the left. A
high natural wall, 100 ft. high, of bright cadmium
yellow for 30 ft. in its lower part, of vivid red for 50 ft.
above that, and darker red above, barred our way
in front (north). On its summit were peculiar white-barked
slender trees&mdash;so white that they looked almost
as if they had been painted, but of course they had
not. The entire centre of the river, forming there an
extensive basin, was blocked by a high bank of gravel,
leaving merely narrow channels close to the banks.
The high wall deflected the stream from 290&deg; to bearings
magnetic 30&deg;. A range of hills some 300 ft. high
then appeared before us, extending from N.N.W. to
S.S.E.</p>

<p>We went over a stony place which obstructed
almost the entire river, except a narrow channel
close to the banks. That was followed by rapids.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-39" id="Pg_2-39"></a>[<a href="images/2-39.png">39</a>]</span>
Some 2 kil. 300 m. farther, a hill range to the north
switched the stream sharply from north to north-west,
which direction it kept with a mere deviation of 20&deg;
for 6,500 m.</p>

<p>The stream was then 100 metres wide nearly all
along, and of amazing beauty. Yet another stony place
disturbed the placidity of the transparent crystal-like
water. At the end of that wonderful stretch of river
came another great vertical wall, on the left side&mdash;of
most brilliant colouring, a stratum of vivid red 60 ft.
deep with thin bright horizontal yellow streaks, and an
upper stratum 18 ft. thick of a similar dazzling yellow.
The northern portion of the cliff differed in colouring,
and had a brown lower stratum 30 ft. thick, followed
upwards by a yellow stratum 2 ft. thick, and a red
stratum&mdash;a most brilliant vermilion&mdash;15 ft. thick.
Above was a pink layer 15 ft. thick and a summit
deposit of brown earth 45 ft. deep. There again the
river was shifted by that obstacle from b.m. 290&deg; to
due north. A charming island&mdash;which I baptized
Bridget Island&mdash;700 m. long and 100 m. wide, absolutely
smothered in vegetation, was found there. It
had an extensive spur of yellow sand and gravel. The
right bank was sparsely wooded with open country
behind. Two channels were found, one flowing north-west,
40 m. wide, the other north-east, 30 m. broad.
We followed the latter, where the rapids seemed less
fearsome than in the broader channel.</p>

<p>At the end of Bridget Island another island, 500 m.
long, was found, which we called Lucky Island. This
second island was 200 m. down stream from the first,
and was situated at the junction of the River dos Patos<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-40" id="Pg_2-40"></a>[<a href="images/2-40.png">40</a>]</span>
("river of ducks") with the River Arinos on the right
side of the latter stream.</p>

<p>We were amazed to see opposite the island on the
right bank a fishing tackle and some clothes. As we
had already gone 89 kil. 850 m. that day, having kept
an average speed of 11 kil. 250 m. an hour, and the
sun was about to set, we decided to halt on "Lucky
Island" for the night. We were busy preparing our
dinner when a strange figure appeared on the right
bank, rifle in hand. His astonishment at seeing us
was no greater than ours at seeing him.</p>

<p>"Who were we?" "Where did we come from?"
"What did we want there?" "Where were we going?"</p>

<p>All those questions having been duly answered, I
sent my canoe over to ferry the fellow across. He
was one of the queerest men I have ever met. His
eyes constantly roamed about like those of a wild
feline animal. He never kept still a moment, springing
up unexpectedly to his feet when he was sitting
down, and squatting himself down when he had been
standing up. All the time he was handling his rifle&mdash;a
very handsome one&mdash;and with rapid movements
watched intently now one then another of our party.
He seemed in a state of great nervous strain and
excitement. He appeared to be a first or second
cross of Indians and negroes&mdash;quite young, some
twenty-four years of age. He had very little clothing
upon his person, which showed limbs of extraordinary
muscular strength. Seldom is it given to one to see
so cruel a face, seldom were criminal characteristics so
clearly marked on any one's countenance and in the
formation of the skull. A man with a face like that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-41" id="Pg_2-41"></a>[<a href="images/2-41.png">41</a>]</span>
could be capable of any crime. His conversation
supplied ample further testimony that his physiognomy
had not deceived me. I had so far thought that my
men were the coarsest, the most brutal individuals I
had ever met, but they were not in it at all with the
strange figure we had before us. The conversation of
my men had seemed to me disgustingly vulgar, but it
now appeared the acme of refinement when the new
man opened his mouth to talk. Good gracious me!
what extraordinary oaths&mdash;what perversion of ideas&mdash;what
foaming hatred for the Creator, our Saviour,
all the saints imaginable, and humanity in general!
Evidently the poor man had a screw loose somewhere
within his brain-case.</p>

<p>I gave him some tobacco, a quantity of which I
carried for my men. Without a word of acknowledgment
he seized it, and, with paper my men gave him,
proceeded to make himself a cigarette.</p>

<p>"I am tired of this life," said he, as he rolled the
tobacco. "I am a slave. I owe my master 1 conto
200 milreis (&pound;80). He sold me this rifle, and some
cartridges, and I cannot repay him. I am rotting
away with fever. I am dying of starvation, I am
going mad in this place.... I have no more food, and
have been unable for three days to catch fish. Do not
let me die here. Take me with you. I will give you
my rifle, this ring"&mdash;a cheap ring which he proceeded
to take from his finger&mdash;"I shall work hard and require
no pay if you will save me from death."</p>

<p>I told him that he had better consider his position
seriously before doing anything rash. We should not
be leaving until the next morning.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-42" id="Pg_2-42"></a>[<a href="images/2-42.png">42</a>]</span>
The man, whom we shall call X, as I do not wish
to divulge his real name, sat up the entire night talking
to my men. His excitement was great&mdash;at least,
judging by the loudness of his voice. During those
long sleepless hours&mdash;with all of them shouting at the
top of their voices it was impossible to sleep&mdash;I overheard
the entire history of his life. What a life! I
prayed my stars that X would change his mind and
decide to stay where he was, for though I needed extra
men badly I feared that his company would not be a
welcome addition to our party, bad as it was. Like
all men who have lived much in seclusion, he possessed
marvellous vitality and magnetism. My men were
simply hypnotised by the remarkable tales of his deeds,
or rather misdeeds.</p>

<p>Long before we were ready to start, X went to
seat himself in the canoe to make sure we should not
leave him behind. When I asked him to reconsider
once more what he was doing, which was not fair to
his master, no matter how bad he may have been, X
positively refused to remain there.</p>

<p>"If you do not want me to come," he said with
determination, "you will have to fling me into the
water and keep my head under until I am drowned."</p>

<p>That was rather a trying dilemma. Much as I
disapprove of slavery, I did not like the idea of taking
matters into my own hands and freeing other people's
slaves; yet it was impossible to refuse assistance to
a suffering man when he asked for it. In any case I
had no wish to be responsible for his death.</p>

<p>"X," I said to him, "you have quite made up
your mind to go with us?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-43" id="Pg_2-43"></a>[<a href="images/2-43.png">43</a>]</span>
"Yes."</p>

<p>"Will you promise faithfully that you will work
and give no trouble?"</p>

<p>"May my old father and mother be struck by
lightning this moment if I shall give you trouble!"
was his reply.</p>

<p>"Very good, X. You can keep your rifle and
cartridges and your ring"&mdash;he had just deposited
them at my feet&mdash;"they are your own property. I
do not want them. You shall receive the same salary
as the other men from this day as long as you do your
work satisfactorily."</p>

<p>X jumped out of the canoe to embrace me. On
his brutal face was for a moment an expression of
gratitude ... he rested his head upon my shoulder
and sobbed for many minutes.</p>

<p>With a crew of six men, things were a little better
for us. Four could paddle while one steered, and the
sixth stood on the prow with a long pole punting, or
on the look-out for dangerous obstacles.</p>

<p>X paddled with such vigour that Alcides at the
helm had the greatest difficulty in keeping the canoe
straight. It had a good effect on the other men, who
also paddled away with all their might, and we were
speeding along with the strong current almost as fast
as a steam launch.</p>

<p>The minimum temperature during the night (July
8th-9th) had been 57&deg; Fahr. The elevation above
the sea level of Lucky Island was 1,100 ft.</p>

<p>The River dos Patos came from the S.S.E., then
bent to the east where its sources were.</p>

<p>Lucky Island was 250 m. in length. The river had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-44" id="Pg_2-44"></a>[<a href="images/2-44.png">44</a>]</span>
an average width of 80 m. As we went along my
men sang gaily, particularly X, who seemed like a
bird let out of its cage, so happy did he feel at being
a free man again. His r&eacute;pertoire was not of the
choicest kind, but what was lacking in quality was
made up in quantity. For some hours we were
treated to a vocal concert, X's solos sending my men
into fits of merriment. His wit&mdash;of the crudest kind&mdash;was
sometimes funny.</p>

<p>This great gaiety seemed most weird in that region
where silence reigned supreme always. The voices
seemed to travel immense distances, echoed from one
side to the other of the river. Words were reproduced
with great clearness by the echo two or three times
over. Especially when we had forest on both sides of
the stream was the echo particularly perfect.</p>

<p>Quantities of rubber trees&mdash;absolutely going to
waste&mdash;were to be seen now on one side, then on the
other, of the river where the banks were wooded.</p>

<hr />
<p>Another most beautiful island, 800 m. long and
80 m. wide&mdash;Pedro de Toledo Island&mdash;was passed. It
had a channel 10 m. wide in a north-westerly direction,
another, which we followed, 50 m. broad, north-east.
On emerging from this channel at the end of the island
we were in a basin 140 m. in diameter. Some 3 kils.
farther, another great basin was crossed&mdash;very shallow,
only 2 ft. deep&mdash;with a gravel bottom. The current
was swift. Then, 2 kils. beyond, yet another basin,
100 metres wide, 1&frac12; ft. deep, with strong eddies, was
crossed. The river, which had so far kept more or
less in a northerly direction, at that point actually
swung round in two consecutive angles from 350&deg;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-45" id="Pg_2-45"></a>[<a href="images/2-45.png">45</a>]</span>
north to due south, in which direction it flowed for
1,000 m. An immaculately white beach was on the
right of us, on which we duly stranded. It was quite
enough for Alcides to see an obstacle of any kind in
the river for him to send the canoe right over it. I
seized that opportunity to land and commence a most
interesting collection of the innumerable minute sand
plants which were to be found on those beaches.</p>

<p>Where the river turned north once more there
stood a hill 100 ft. high, the lower half of which was
of red volcanic rock, the upper half of yellow earth.
Along the water's edge a thick and florid growth of
bamboo could be seen in many places, while on the
edge of the forest hung myriads of purple convolvuli.
For hundreds of kilometres the Arinos was indeed one
of the most ideally beautiful rivers I have ever seen.
Its banks of alluvial formation, 25 to 30 ft. high, had
<i>chapada</i> on their tops. Farther on the <i>chapada</i> gave
way once more to dense forest with plentiful rubber
trees. Another basin, 150 m. in diameter, was met
with, after which we entered a channel from 40 to 50 m.
wide, through which the stream was compressed.</p>

<p>A pretty little islet of gravel, 100 m. long, 20 m.
wide, and rising 6 ft. above the water, had a tuft of
trees growing on it, and a spur, also of gravel, extending
westward for more than another 100 m. The river in
that section flowed in a W.N.W. direction for 1,400 m.</p>

<p>We soon after came to a shallow basin (1 ft. deep)
100 m. wide, in which eddies were strong and troublesome.
There were many pointed rocks scattered about
in its bed of gravel, as well as three parallel rocky
barriers right across the basin.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-46" id="Pg_2-46"></a>[<a href="images/2-46.png">46</a>]</span>
A rivulet 2 m. wide at the mouth entered the
Arinos on the right side, while on the left side we had
an island 800 m. long, leaving two channels, one 10 m.
wide, the other 40 m. A tiny streamlet flowed into
the main stream on the left. Banks, regular dunes of
gravel, were formed where the river broadened into
basins. We came to a basin 400 m. wide and extremely
shallow. Three channels&mdash;W.N.W., N.W., and N.N.E.&mdash;were
formed in the river by two islands, each 400 m.
long&mdash;the Two Sisters Islands&mdash;which were in the
centre. We found the N.N.E. channel the best.
Where the river narrowed again to a width of 50 m.
huge rocks stood in the centre. From that point for
some 300 m. we went over a succession of gravel banks
and nasty rocks forming barriers across the stream.</p>

<p>Small streamlets entered the Arinos, one on the left,
the other on the right. A cluster of high rocks was
on the right bank. On both sides were extensive
white sand beaches. The river soon widened to 100 m.
in a basin with an islet 12 ft. high, and a cluster of
trees on its north-east side. Another island 6 ft. high,
80 m. long&mdash;Mosquito Island&mdash;with a spit of gravel
to the south, was near it.</p>

<p>Rubber trees were most plentiful on the right bank
where the forest was thick, whereas on the left bank
was <i>chapada</i>. Huge gorgeous butterflies with black-striped
brown wings and velvety bodies flew in great
numbers around the canoe. Some settled on my hat,
hands, and on the sleeves of my white shirt. They
were so unaccustomed to see human beings that when
touched they did not attempt to fly away.</p>

<p>The river was getting more and more wonderful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-47" id="Pg_2-47"></a>[<a href="images/2-47.png">47</a>]</span>
every hour as we went along&mdash;in great straight lines
of 3,500 m., 3,000 m., 2,200 m., 2,000 m., 4,000 m., in
length.</p>

<p>Some ducks rose from the water only a few yards
in front of the canoe. The man who was behind me
fired with his carbine close to my head. The bullet
grazed my right ear. It was a trifle trying to be
travelling with such careless sportsmen, but the best
thing was to say nothing and go on.</p>

<p>A big island&mdash;Passos Island&mdash;300 m. long, preceded
by a smaller islet 80 m. long&mdash;Passos Junior I.&mdash;was
subsequently passed, where the river formed a channel
(N.W.) 50 m. wide and a minor one (W.) 30 m.</p>

<p>The river there changed from a westerly course to
W.S.W. Once more we had before us a great wall
of red rock which at first seemed to bar our way. In
the lower section of the wall was a cave eroded by
water and extending some way back. It was too low
to be entered by the canoe. The lower stratum of the
wall was at an angle&mdash;in other words, had a dip of 21&deg;&mdash;while
the stratum above it, 30 ft. in thickness, intersected
by a yellow band, was perfectly horizontal.
On the left side of this high natural wall was a charming
waterfall of limpid water. Farther on a great
land-slip displayed for a length of 40 m. brilliant red
earth over a stratum 60 ft. thick of white chalk. The
river, which described a number of turns, was bordered
on the left side by a hill range covered with handsome
trees.</p>

<p>The ardour of my men for rowing had already
passed away. They smoked and sang the whole time,
and let the current&mdash;fortunately strong&mdash;carry us along.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-48" id="Pg_2-48"></a>[<a href="images/2-48.png">48</a>]</span>
Whenever I remonstrated they scooped the water
carelessly with their paddles for a few minutes. As
is the case with individuals mentally deficient, everything
seemed to distract them. One moment it was
the flight of a <i>jacutinga</i>&mdash;a handsome black gallinaceous
bird with a white crest. Another moment it was the
jump of an inquisitive fish. Many <i>mergulh&atilde;o commun</i>
(<i>Podiceps Americanus</i>), wonderfully graceful, velvety
black birds with long beaks, flew about unconcerned
from tree to tree. Whenever anything moved about
anywhere, the paddles were abandoned, the rifles were
seized, and there was a regular fusillade. The men
seldom hit anything, although on many occasions,
with the unsteady canoe, we all of us had narrow
escapes. One day the man in front of me fired a shot
at a bird&mdash;but so close to my head, not more than one
foot away, that the concussion blinded me for several
seconds. On other occasions the rifles went off when
they were not expected to. I had ceased to give
orders of any kind about the careful use of the weapons.
It was time and lung-power absolutely wasted, and
only made things worse.</p>

<p>After floating down a beautiful stretch of 3,000 m.,
two more islands were reached within a great circle
over 200 m. wide. A small tributary entered the
Arinos on the right bank. Another island, 500 m.
long, was seen farther down, at the end of which, where
two channels met again, violent eddies were produced
by the meeting of the two strong currents.</p>

<p>Immense quantities of <i>Siphonia elastica</i> were there
to be seen on both sides of the stream in the forest,
which was getting more and more luxuriant as we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-49" id="Pg_2-49"></a>[<a href="images/2-49.png">49</a>]</span>
proceeded on our journey farther north. Many wild
banana palms (<i>bananeira do matto</i>) were to be seen
here and there along the lovely, deliciously clean river,
with its extraordinarily tidy banks.</p>

<p>Another great basin, 300 m. in diameter, was met,
with three islands and two gravel beaches in its centre.
The two principal islands&mdash;Paolo and Francesca&mdash;were
each 100 m. long and 50 m. wide.</p>

<p>We now made the acquaintance of the <i>capivara</i>
(<i>Hydrochoerus capibara</i>), a rodent which we found
common farther down in those waters. It was a stupid
animal. When fired at several times by my men it
remained perfectly still, gazing at its enemies. It
was only when a bullet hit the ground too near that it
would move away, surprised more than concerned.</p>

<p>After going down a <i>corrideira</i> (small rapid) we encountered
thousands of white and lemon-yellow butterflies.
On islets of red earth swarms of them were
basking in the sun&mdash;which was getting hotter and
hotter as we got farther north.</p>

<p>Again we were soon after faced by a high natural
wall of brilliant yellow and red colouring. In its
western part it showed a white stratum 3 ft. thick
upon a layer of yellow lava of an equal thickness. A
stratum of lighter yellow was nearest the surface of
the water, while above was a thick layer of grey earth.
On the right side, at this point, a tributary streamlet
flowed into the Arinos. The basin formed by the
crescent-shaped wall was perfectly circular. When the
river emerged from it, it folded back from 40&deg; b.m.
to 290&deg;.</p>

<p>Owing to the steepness of the banks we experienced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-50" id="Pg_2-50"></a>[<a href="images/2-50.png">50</a>]</span>
difficulty in finding a suitable camping place for the
night. Eventually at sunset we had to clear with
our big knives a patch in the dirty forest on the
edge of the stream. I never liked to camp out of sight
of the canoe in case anything happened during the
night&mdash;an attack, a flood, a forest fire, or anybody
trying to steal or get away with the canoe; the danger
from my own men being quite as great as from any
enemy I could have found. I well knew that if we
lost that canoe we were done for entirely.</p>

<p>There was a great falling off in the distance covered
that day owing to the laziness of my men. We had
only gone 67 kil. 600 m.&mdash;or 22 kil. 250 m. less than
the previous day, when we had travelled less hours
and gone easily over a distance of 89 kil. 850 m.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Oleo Pardo</i> Trees&mdash;Beautiful Palms&mdash;The River Bottom&mdash;Swarms of

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> night of July 10th was cool&mdash;minimum temperature
58&deg; F. When we departed at 7.10 in the morning the
river was extremely tortuous at first&mdash;in one place
actually veering from north to due south. On the right
side of us was a lake divided by a low bank, 3 to 5 ft.
high, from the river by which it was fed. The entrance
into the lake was narrow. We had hardly gone
1 kil. when we found ourselves in a great basin 300 m.
long, 200 m. wide, with one large island&mdash;Nellie Island&mdash;150 m.
in length, and several other small islets in
its centre.</p>

<p>Another lagoon was shortly after reached on the
right bank, its inlet being 10 m. wide.</p>

<p>The waters of the Arinos were, at this point, of a
leaden placidity. We seemed to travel slowly now
that the current did not help us. The river was again
compressed into a deep channel 50 m. wide. Before us
loomed a cliff 100 ft. high, reflected with irreproachable
faithfulness in the almost still waters of the
stream. There was not a breath of wind to disturb
the mirror-like surface, nor to cool our sweating brows
in the stifling heat of the broiling sun. The lower 40<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-52" id="Pg_2-52"></a>[<a href="images/2-52.png">52</a>]</span>
to 60 ft. of the cliff was red, the upper light yellow&mdash;almost
white. Where we reached this rocky wall there
was a circle 150 m. in diameter, with a low, thickly-wooded
triangular island, 80 m. long, 100 m. wide&mdash;Eleonora
Island.</p>

<p>The north-eastern passage was shallow, with a stony
bottom. We followed the northern channel along the
vertical wall. On leaving the island we came to a
stretch 2,500 m. long of beautiful water flowing due
north, with ideally fascinating banks embellished by
dense vegetation&mdash;neat, clean, and healthy&mdash;of the
richest green.</p>

<p>After crossing a bay, 100 m. wide, with volcanic
rocks showing through on both banks and in the river
bed, the stream was squeezed through a rocky neck
25 m. wide, and spread again immediately afterwards
to its normal width of 50 m. We were beginning to
find big rocks more frequently, many in the river channel&mdash;a
bad sign for us, for I feared we might soon encounter
rapids.</p>

<p>Wonderful <i>oleo pardo</i> trees (<i>Myrocarpus frondosus</i>
Fr. All.), with their octopus-like branches hanging
down to the water, were fairly common in that region.
There were two kinds of <i>oleo</i> trees in Brazil&mdash;the brown
or <i>oleo pardo</i> and the red or <i>oleo vermelho</i>, the latter
technically known as <i>Myrospermum erytroxylon</i> Fr.
All.</p>

<p>We subsequently entered a basin 150 m. wide which
contained a circular island 100 m. in diameter&mdash;Horus
Island.</p>

<p>Eight hundred metres farther we came to another
large circular bay with a large globular mass of lava on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-53" id="Pg_2-53"></a>[<a href="images/2-53.png">53</a>]</span>
its left side. The current was very swift over a nasty
rocky bottom. The canoe was suddenly flung by the
current between an accumulation of rocks and an
island, and, as we found it impossible to turn, floated
down at an uncomfortable speed through a narrow
channel, dodging as best we could the many ugly
rocks just below the surface of the water. At the end
of this channel we encountered violent eddies forming
wide circles of most treacherous water&mdash;although on
the surface it looked placid enough.</p>

<p>The tributary Sumidoro, 30 m. wide at its mouth,
entered the Arinos from the west-south-west at this
point. Its water was deliciously clear. A little way off
to the left we could hear the noise of a waterfall on the
Sumidoro, before it joined the Arinos.</p>

<p>The river, after the meeting of this important
tributary, became even more exquisitely beautiful than
before. Rocks strewn about added to the picturesqueness
of the landscape as well as to the dangers of
navigation, while springs of crystalline water, cool and
quite delicious to drink, descended here and there from
the banks.</p>

<p>The river had an average width of 60 m. in this
part, and was much strewn with broken-up volcanic
boulders, especially on the left bank. On the right
bank was a beach of immaculate white sand. For
300 m. we went over a great stony place with shallow
water. We had to be careful, but all the same many
times did we bump with great force and get stuck
upon submerged rocks&mdash;which we could not see owing
to the blinding, glittering refraction of the sun upon
the troubled waters.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-54" id="Pg_2-54"></a>[<a href="images/2-54.png">54</a>]</span>
A tributary 4 m. wide, coming from the north-east,
entered the Arinos on the right bank. A great number
of rubber trees were to be seen on the right bank,
where the forest was luxuriant; but not on the left
bank, where the growth of trees was scanty. <i>Carand&aacute;</i>
or <i>burity</i> or <i>tucuman</i> palms were plentiful along the
water's edge near the spot where a small rivulet entered
the Arinos on the left bank. Two thousand metres
farther down we came upon denuded country, low,
and liable to inundation when the river rose. Farther
on were campos and open country, with the exception
of a thin row of trees immediately along the river.
On the left we had luxuriant forest, wonderfully
healthy, neat and clean. The stream was there beautiful&mdash;60
to 70 m. wide.</p>

<p>When we had gone 10 kils. 800 m. more the entire
channel became strewn with rocks and mounds only
1 ft. below the surface of the water, and not unlike
parallel small dunes of sand with a deposit of gravel
upon them. For 700 m. the river was obstructed and
navigation rendered somewhat troublesome.</p>

<p>Where the river turned from bearings magnetic
310&deg; to 360&deg; (due N.) we went over a nasty stony place
with a strong <i>corrideira</i> above it, and we were confronted
with a rocky barrier almost the entire width
across the stream. We kept on the west side, the
only way where it was possible to get the canoe through.
A little farther another <i>corrideira</i>, stronger than the
first, obliged us to find a passage on the east side of
the river&mdash;which bore upon its bank <i>campos</i> and
<i>chapada</i>. Curious mounds of white sand and gravel
were visible in the centre of the river, and also near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-55" id="Pg_2-55"></a>[<a href="images/2-55.png">55</a>]</span>
the left bank below the second <i>corrideira</i>; then we
came to parallel ridges of white sand and gravel right
across the river bottom at an angle of 45&deg; in relation
to the general direction of the stream.</p>

<p>Two tributaries, one 3 m. wide on the left bank, the
other 4 m. wide on the right side (the latter coming
from the north-east), swelled the Arinos from that
point. The width of the stream was now increased to
80 m., the water being shallow. The bed of the river
was ever changing, and supplied me with constant
interest. It was adorned with strangely precise triangles
of beautiful white sand exposed through a layer
of gravel which covered most of the river bottom.</p>

<p>A thickly-wooded hill range, 150 ft. high and extending
from W.S.W. to E.N.E., stood to the north
of us. Its slopes, eroded by the water, had caused a
landslip, leaving bare vertical red rock for half the
height of the hill-range and two much eroded spurs
of bright yellow and white earth extending into the
stream.</p>

<p>The river at that point turned from north to east.
Open country was again on our right after leaving the
hill range, and lowlands liable to inundation. Soon
afterwards, however, higher land appeared with banks
35 ft. high.</p>

<p>Swarms of small white butterflies played upon the
banks on the edge of the water.</p>

<p>Sand and gravel mounds were numerous in the
centre of the channel, with occasional basins of shallow
water with <i>corrideiras</i> upon them. For instance, in
one of those places for 150 m. the river was only from
1 to 3 ft. deep, and we had to drag the long heavy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-56" id="Pg_2-56"></a>[<a href="images/2-56.png">56</a>]</span>
canoe, which drew 2 ft. of water, along the undulating
gravel bed. In fact, we spent a good deal
of our time every day in the water, pushing or pulling
along the canoe over innumerable obstacles, her great
length making it difficult to navigate her properly
through the many shallow and tortuous passages.</p>

<p>In a circular basin, 120 m. in diameter, beyond
that point we encountered strong eddies near the left
bank. On the north side big rocks emerged from the
water and a <i>corrideira</i> was formed.</p>

<p>An island 50 m. long and two other islets were
separated from the mainland by two channels, one
20 m. wide and only 3 in. deep&mdash;the other 60 m. wide
and 3 ft. deep. The right bank was there 45 ft. high.</p>

<p>Fifteen hundred metres farther down we entered
another basin 200 m. in diameter, with an island 80 m.
long and eight dry beaches of gravel.</p>

<p>My men were greatly excited in trying to capture
a <i>capivara</i> they had wounded. We actually got the
animal on board, but my men were so timid in going
near it that it jumped overboard again and made its
escape.</p>

<p>The right bank, which had been high, was now
reduced to only 4 ft. above the water; whereas the
left bank rose to a height of 46 ft. A rivulet 3 m. wide
coming from the west had cut its way through the
latter bank.</p>

<p>The main river was getting more and more magnificent
at every turn. I should have enjoyed the
journey very much had it not been for the constant
attention I had to pay to my men, who left their
paddles and steering gear at every moment in order to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-57" id="Pg_2-57"></a>[<a href="images/2-57.png">57</a>]</span>
fire recklessly at birds or <i>ariranhas</i> or <i>capivaras</i>, much
to the danger of everybody on board. They would
blaze away with their repeating rifles&mdash;and bullet cartridges,
of course&mdash;at parrots and even <i>colibri</i> birds
100 or 200 metres off. They said the rifles were bad
because they could never hit anything! I had ceased
scolding them. They made me positively ill with pity,
I was only praying for our supply of cartridges to come
to an end soon, so that if we were to die at all it might
not be through being pierced by one of our own
bullets.</p>

<p>The river had been flowing, with slight deviations,
northwards.</p>

<p>We came to an enchanting island 70 m. wide, with
thick vegetation upon it and fine rocks.</p>

<p>The river in that portion flowed practically north
in great stretches of 6,000 and 4,000 m. Another large
and beautiful island, 250 m. long and 70 wide&mdash;Ghislaine
Island&mdash;was passed, and we admired the gorgeous
vegetation upon it.</p>

<p>Below the island the river was 100 m. wide and
very shallow&mdash;not more than from 1 to 4 ft. in depth.
We halted at sunset, having gone that day 92 kil.
300 m.</p>

<p>During the night of July 11th my men suffered a
great deal from cold, the thermometer being as low as
45&deg; Fahrenheit. In the morning there was a thick fog
over the river&mdash;so thick that we had to delay our departure
until eight o'clock, as we could not see more
than two or three metres ahead.</p>

<p>Two kilometres beyond we came to a rivulet, 2 m.
wide, on the left bank, and soon after to a small <i>corri<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-58" id="Pg_2-58"></a>[<a href="images/2-58.png">58</a>]</span>deira</i>
with a navigable channel in the centre. Three
hundred metres farther down we passed another
tributary on the right bank. There was open country
with sparse stunted trees on the left of us, thick forest
with plenty of rubber trees on the right. I noticed
several good specimens of the <i>pao dolce</i>&mdash;a tree with
a curious cluster of yellow flowers not unlike the
flower of wistaria upside down. Not only was the <i>pao
dolce</i> pretty to look at, but a most refreshing beverage
could be made from a decoction of its leaves.</p>

<p>The course of the river was winding, with basins
and rapids of no great importance. Another tributary
2 m. wide was reached on the left bank, and soon after
another tiny streamlet entered the Arinos from the
same side.</p>

<p>I had a narrow escape. One of the men, who was
sitting behind me in the canoe, saw an <i>ariranha</i> (<i>Lutra
Brasiliensis</i>) put its head out of the water only ten
metres in front of the canoe. In his great hurry to kill
the beautiful animal he seized his rifle and emptied the
eight shots out of his magazine, firing the first three
shots close to my head on the left side, the other five
just as close on the other side. The muzzle of his
rifle was so near my ear that the noise deafened me for
several minutes and my hair was almost singed off.
The <i>ariranha</i>, needless to say, escaped unhurt, and
luckily so did I.</p>

<p>We went over a long strip of shallow water from
1 to 3 ft. deep. We now had open country on the
right bank, with a small streamlet finding its way into
the Arinos on that side. The river was flowing again
in long straight stretches&mdash;3,000 m., 2,000 m., 2,500 m.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-59" id="Pg_2-59"></a>[<a href="images/2-59.png">59</a>]</span>
in length. In the portions where the banks were
thickly wooded innumerable rubber trees were to be
seen.</p>

<p>In the centre of a basin 150 m. wide we found another
island, 100 m. long and 50 m. wide, absolutely
smothered in vegetation and with a handsome gravel
spit at its southern end. Two kilometres farther another
basin, 300 m. broad, appeared. An amazing
quantity of rubber trees was to be seen round that
basin. Near the water we also found fine specimens
of the <i>mate</i> (<i>Ilex Paraguayensis</i> St. Hil.), with its wax-like
leaves, much used in certain parts of South
America for making a kind of tea.</p>

<p>For close upon 13 kils. the river flowed&mdash;with
slight deviations&mdash;almost always due north, and with
its limpid waters was of extraordinary beauty. The
country was open on the right side of us. We saw that
day two white <i>urub&uacute;</i> (<i>Cathartes</i>). The Brazilians have
a curious superstition about them. They say that if
you write with a quill taken from the wing of one of
these birds any business which you may be transacting
will go well; in fact, anything you may wish to do
and which you set down on paper with one of these
quills and ink is sure to turn out successfully.</p>

<p>That day I again suffered much, while taking
astronomical observations, from the millions of bees
and other insects which settled in swarms upon my
hands and face and stung me all over. We were then
in lat. 12&deg; 26&#8242;&middot;5 S., long. 56&deg; 37&#8242; W. The temperature
in the sun was not unbearable&mdash;merely 85&deg; Fahr.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, after we had enjoyed an excellent
lunch of fish, tinned provisions, and rice&mdash;my men also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-60" id="Pg_2-60"></a>[<a href="images/2-60.png">60</a>]</span>
enjoying their <i>feijao</i> (boiled beans)&mdash;we continued our
journey. The river for 9,000 m. displayed first clean
<i>campos</i> and <i>chapada</i> on the left bank and dense forest
on the right, then <i>campos</i> on the right bank and a belt
of forest along the river on the left.</p>

<p>The <i>campos</i> were particularly neat in that region&mdash;merely
a few <i>burity</i> and <i>tucum</i> palms flourishing on the
edge of the water. In other localities a thick growth
of beautiful bamboos interspersed with gigantic palms
lined the banks.</p>

<p>Where the river turned due east we came to fairly
strong rapids. The water was shallow with mounds
of gravel, and we bumped about a great deal. Eventually
we all had to get into the water and push the
canoe along for greater comfort.</p>

<p>The river next formed a huge basin, 900 m. long
and 200 m. wide. A small tributary flowed into the
Arinos in the crescent-shaped bank on the right. That
bank had a height of 80 ft. On its summit quantities
of <i>Siphonia elastica</i> were to be admired. Farther
down it was on the left side that the river had high
banks, some 60 ft. high.</p>

<p>We went over a charming little <i>corrideira</i>. Strong
eddies were encountered on emerging from the rapids.
Where the right bank became lower&mdash;only 40 ft.&mdash;<i>chapada</i>
replaced the forest. The left bank was but
1 ft. above the level of the river, and the low country
beyond (south) was naturally liable to inundation.
For 4,000 m. the left bank was never higher than 4 ft.
The right bank also suddenly became very low in
that region.</p>

<p>Where the river turned from 290&deg; b.m. to 320&deg;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-61" id="Pg_2-61"></a>[<a href="images/2-61.png">61</a>]</span>
b.m., there was a basin 700 m. broad with low banks.
An island&mdash;Lydia Island&mdash;200 m. in circumference,
rose within this basin on the north side and was
luxuriantly wooded.</p>

<p>We found that day beautiful beaches of gravel,
mostly on the right side. Then strong rapids and
<i>corrideiras</i>; below these more clean-looking gravel
beaches&mdash;this time on the left&mdash;were visible, and an
extensive island of gravel close to the right bank.</p>

<p>For 8,000 m. the gorgeous stream flowed almost in
a direct line northward, with dense forest and a wealthy
growth of rubber trees on both sides. Wonderful
<i>figueira</i> trees with their spotless white branches embellished
the landscape.</p>

<p>On the left a tributary of some size entered the
Arinos from the south-east in two arms with an island
between; the largest arm was 40 m. wide, the smaller
10 m. Then another stream entered the Arinos on the
right side.</p>

<p>We were again confronted by a large basin enclosed
on the north by a crescent-shaped wall 100 ft.
high, at the foot of which at the level of the river was
a quantity of d&eacute;bris of yellow rock. The river at
that spot turned sharply from 20&deg; b.m. (N.N.E.) to
290&deg; b.m.&mdash;that is to say, almost north-west. The
width of the Arinos at this point was from 80 to 100 m.</p>

<p>Towards sunset we came to a beautiful island
200 m. long. We cleared a sufficiently large space in
the dense and gorgeous vegetation to make our camp
for the night.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> had another cool night on July 12th&mdash;minimum
temperature 47&deg; F. It was very damp, and in the
morning we had, as on the previous day, a thick mist
which prevented our starting until it cleared up, at
7.40 a.m. The mist rose in columns and square blocks
over the warmish water of the river. The right bank
of the Arinos was 40 ft. high.</p>

<p>We had gone some 1,500 m. from our camp when
we came to a magnificent island, 400 m. long and 200 m.
wide&mdash;Griselda Island&mdash;which divided the stream into
two channels.</p>

<p>All the islands we had seen of late showed on the
up-stream side a more or less extensive spit of beautifully
coloured gravel and glittering crystals. The
latter shone in the sun with such iridescent luminosity
that it gave those islands a fairy-like appearance.</p>

<p>We encountered troublesome eddies which swung
the canoe about, and in one case actually spun her
completely round in a most alarming manner, tearing
out of Alcides' hands the steering gear, which we had
some trouble in recovering.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-63" id="Pg_2-63"></a>[<a href="images/2-63.png">63</a>]</span>
There were many handsome large-leafed <i>pacov&aacute;</i>,
somewhat resembling banana palms; also quantities
of <i>Siphonia elastica</i>, although these were not quite so
plentiful as farther south nor the trees so high. A
tiny brook of delicious water descended into the Arinos
from the left bank.</p>

<p>Ten thousand five hundred metres farther down
from Griselda Island we came to another island, 300 m.
long and 50 m. broad&mdash;Negrino Island&mdash;with the usual
spit of gravel and beautiful crystals on the south side.
This island was 10 ft. high above the water, with some
trees on it, but not such luxuriant vegetation as on
most of the other islands we had seen.</p>

<p>A stream 5 m. wide at the mouth, coming from the
N.N.W., entered the Arinos on the right side. The
main river had a direction of 305&deg; b.m.&mdash;that is to say,
virtually north-west. Great volcanic slabs of rock and
sand-banks were now reached.</p>

<p>The sun was not extraordinarily hot&mdash;90&deg; F. at noon.
The country on either side was open&mdash;chiefly <i>chapada</i>.
Beautiful gravel beaches were now seen, extending
half-way across the river, particularly from the left side.</p>

<p>Another tributary 5 m. wide coming from the N.N.E.
was passed on our right, and beyond this a thick forest
with rubber trees was visible, while <i>chapada</i> continued
on the left.</p>

<p>Round a big basin 200 m. in diameter, containing
shallow water from 1 to 6 ft. deep, stood a mass of
gigantic trees with verdant healthy foliage, and innumerable
abnormally tall <i>burity</i> palms, over 100 ft. high,
and <i>tucum</i> (<i>Astrocaryum tucuma</i>)&mdash;also of immense size.</p>

<p>Many huge <i>trinch&atilde;o</i> fish followed our canoe for some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-64" id="Pg_2-64"></a>[<a href="images/2-64.png">64</a>]</span>
time, gazing curiously at us. They came so impudently
near that my men actually hit them on the head with
their paddles.</p>

<p>One more streamlet entered the Arinos on the right
side just before we reached a big basin, 250 m. in
diameter, with wonderful gravel beaches in regular
little mounds stretching half-way across the basin.
Another little tributary (on the right side) came next,
7,000 m. farther down stream. The vegetation was
there so dense and so entangled that we could find nowhere
a suitable spot on which to land for our midday
halt. About noon, however, <i>chapada</i> and open country
again appeared on the right bank for a distance of
some 2,000 m.</p>

<p class="fsc">Going down a Violent Rapid in a Narrow Channel.</p>
<hr />
<p>There we indulged in a plentiful lunch, the country
round being as still as death. Not a sign could be
seen anywhere of a human being; not a column of
smoke indicating the presence of man rose anywhere
in the clear sky. Nowhere did we meet disturbed
vegetation; nowhere did we notice a trail or a passage
through the vegetation coming to the water; nowhere
did we meet abandoned camps or any signs whatever
that human beings had ever lived there. There was
no animal life of fair size on the surface; no parrots, no
monkeys, no mammals of any kind&mdash;only millions of
insects, which made one's life a burden.</p>

<p>It was not so with the river, which was swarming
with innocent fish, only too ready to be killed and
supply us with excellent meals. The reason, of course,
that the river was so full of fish, and that the fish displayed
such delightful simplicity, was because there
were there no human beings.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-65" id="Pg_2-65"></a>[<a href="images/2-65.png">65</a>]</span>
Soon after leaving camp&mdash;all the happier for an
excellent lunch&mdash;we came once more to thick, beautiful,
clean forest on both sides. Again rubber was plentiful,
and absolutely untouched by the collector's hand. The
river was getting amazingly beautiful, 200 m. wide
all along, the water like a faultless silver mirror irreproachably
reflecting each leaf, each branch of the
motionless trees on both banks. There was not a
breath of wind to disturb the tranquillity of that
deliciously restful scene.</p>

<p>Yet one more gorgeous island&mdash;Alastor Island&mdash;300
m. long and 80 to 100 m. wide, was seen. It was
preceded on the south-east side by innumerable gravel
mounds just emerging above the water surface, then
by a magnificent gravel beach with numberless beautiful
crystals. On the left bank a tributary 15 m. wide
entered the Arinos from the south-west.</p>

<p>The river was getting more and more entrancing
at every turn. Profuse blossoms of the most gorgeous
yellow shone resplendent in all their beauty against the
background of dark green foliage. The entire edge of
the forest was festooned with daintily-leafed creepers
and with myriads of convolvuli of the purest amethyst
colour.</p>

<p>There was poetry in the scene&mdash;frequently disturbed,
perhaps, by the inconceivable oaths of the
man to whom was entrusted the heavy task of baling
out the water from the canoe, which leaked badly.
She was fissured from end to end, and we had no
effective means of preventing the water coming in; in
fact, if the baling were not done quickly and continuously
with a bucket, the water soon gained and reached<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-66" id="Pg_2-66"></a>[<a href="images/2-66.png">66</a>]</span>
the platform on which we had placed the baggage.
Our feet, of course, were in water all day long. We
did not mind that so much. In fact, our feet got so
soaked with moisture that we could peel off the skin in
big patches with the greatest ease.</p>

<p>After travelling across a basin 250 m. broad, we
came to a <i>corrideira</i> with shallow water. We dashed
with great speed sideways over a bank of gravel, and
nearly turned turtle. The gravel was banked up
against the lee side of the canoe, and with a strong
current pushing her we had the greatest trouble to pull
her off again.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of rubber, particularly on
the left bank, while on the right, <i>chapada</i> was again
observed. The river was so wonderfully tidy that, had
it not been for its great breadth, one would have felt
as if going through a watercourse in England.</p>

<p>From the east came a little tributary, 2 m. wide, on
the right bank. Another beautiful island, 500 m. long
and 80 m. wide&mdash;Helena Island&mdash;a most enchanting
place, preceded by the usual gravel mounds and beach,
was passed in the afternoon. Small streamlets entered
the main stream, one on each side&mdash;one 6 kils. beyond
Helena Island, the other one a little farther.</p>

<p>The river maintained its average width of 200 m.
nearly all the time. Late in the afternoon we passed
on the left bank a hill 120 ft. high, belonging to a
range that extended from E.S.E. to W.N.W. at an
angle to the river, which there flowed in a direction
almost north. There was plenty of rubber of excellent
quality near the water.</p>

<p>Shortly after leaving this range we came to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-67" id="Pg_2-67"></a>[<a href="images/2-67.png">67</a>]</span>
lagoon, then to open campos behind a thin row of
stunted trees on the left bank. The lagoon was situated
at a point where the river described a curve from north
to 70&deg; b.m. Two small streamlets entered the Arinos
on the right. We made camp near a small lagoon in
the forest shortly after sunset.</p>

<p>The distance we had travelled during the last
two days was 86 kil. 900 m. on July 11th, and 76 kil.
600 m. on July 12th, or altogether 163 kil. 500 m.</p>

<p>To anybody accustomed to travelling in equatorial
countries it seems amazing, on returning to civilization,
to find what curious notions people have of the tropical
forest. Even in the case of writers of distinction I
could quote many passages which are painfully ridiculous.
One of the greatest modern Italian writers,
for instance&mdash;who, by the way, in one of his latest
novels, copied almost word for word many pages from
my books&mdash;added the poetic touch that in the tropical
forest flowers were found so large that they could not
be picked, and fruit so enormous that no human tooth
could bite it! Again, the majority of people believe
that it is impossible to go through the forest without
cutting your way all the time&mdash;the "cutting a way
through" meaning to most people the constant chopping
down of trees of all sizes, undergrowth, bamboos,
<i>liane</i>, and other creepers. As a matter of fact, any
experienced traveller has much less trouble in going
through the forest than people imagine. This is not
the case with people unacquainted with the forest, or
with people whose sense of observation is not much
developed. One can go sometimes for miles through
the dense forest without once using knives at all;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-68" id="Pg_2-68"></a>[<a href="images/2-68.png">68</a>]</span>
although necessarily a knife must be carried, as there
are places where a cut from its blade will make passing
through more comfortable. This is particularly true
of the Brazilian forest. The forests of that country,
especially in the central region where I was then travelling,
were wonderfully clean, when once you entered
them, although, when seen from the river, they appeared
impenetrable. Near the water, owing to the
moisture, there was frequently a thick but narrow
belt&mdash;only a few metres wide&mdash;of dense growth. Beyond
it, when you were in the forest itself, nothing
grew under the trees, and the ground was just as clean
as the best kept English park. One could walk in
comfort without the slightest trouble, an occasional
well-applied blow with the heavy-bladed knife disentangling
in a second an interfering <i>liana</i> which might
stand in one's way.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that you can get under
or over <i>liane</i>, or shift them on one side, without ever
having the trouble of severing them. It is only occasionally,
when they are entangled, that it saves time
to cut them. Barring an occasional thick belt along
the Amazon River, it is almost safe to assert that an
experienced man can travel, alone, anywhere in the
forests of Brazil without carrying a penknife. This is
not the case, of course, when you are travelling with a
caravan and with baggage, when a sufficiently large
passage has to be opened.</p>

<p>In Africa the equatorial forests are incomparably
more difficult to traverse than the Brazilian forests,
and those who assert the Brazilian forests to be impenetrable
only say so because they do not know what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-69" id="Pg_2-69"></a>[<a href="images/2-69.png">69</a>]</span>
they are talking about. Even when it comes to
actually chopping down trees in the Brazilian forests,
one blow with the axe or with the knife will easily cut
down a fair-sized tree. As I have already stated elsewhere,
most of the Brazilian forest trees have no resistance
whatever. They are full of water, and, with a
judicious blow, can be cut almost as easily as celery.
Many are the trees also, the inside of which near the
ground has been eaten up entirely by ants, and it
was not uncommon when you leant heavily against a
tree that you and the tree tumbled down. Ants do
not seem to attack lactiferous trees, such as those
producing rubber, which therefore flourished in that
particular region.</p>

<p>Most of the trees in that particular part of the
forest were small in diameter, and only had branches
or leaves at a very great height. That was why the
forests in Brazil looked so extraordinarily clean beneath,
in contrast to the equatorial forest in such
countries as Central Africa or the Philippine Islands.
The wonderful cleanliness of the river, to which I have
so often alluded, was a great contrast to the masses of
floating decomposing vegetation which is always to
be seen in the African rivers.</p>

<p>The minimum temperature during the night of
July 13th was 51&deg; Fahr. During that night we were
suddenly roused by our dogs barking furiously. We
heard strange noises, as if people were trying to run
away quickly through the forest. Indians had, much
to our surprise, come quite close to our camp, and had
it not been for the alarm given by the dogs we should
most likely have been attacked by them. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-70" id="Pg_2-70"></a>[<a href="images/2-70.png">70</a>]</span>
morning we heard in the distance their war-cries and
piercing ululations, which rent the air. Judging merely
by the noise they made, there must have been from
thirty to fifty of them. My men were greatly excited
over this experience. These Indians belonged, I think,
to the Tapanhonas tribe.</p>

<p>We left our camp at 7.45 in the morning. As the
river was there in an almost straight line for 8 kil.,
we continued hearing&mdash;more and more faintly, of
course, as we went on&mdash;for some distance the excited
yells of the Indians.</p>

<p>The left bank, through which a streamlet cut its way
into the Arinos, was fairly open with <i>chapada</i>. An island,
150 m. wide and 200 m. long&mdash;Julia Island&mdash;was next
seen. It had an extensive beach of gravel at its
southern end, and the island itself was covered with
dense and very beautiful vegetation. Another streamlet
1 m. wide entered the Arinos opposite the island
from the left side. Farther on another streamlet, 3 m.
wide at the mouth, and coming from the north, flowed
into the main stream on the right side. Three and a
half kilometres farther another tributary streamlet,
also 3 m. wide, was met on the right. We there saw
<i>chapada</i> on both banks as we went along, with merely
a thin edge of trees along the river.</p>

<p>Where the river described a graceful elbow, a
charming tongue of land, with deliciously green grass
upon it, was most refreshing to the eyes. A river 8 m.
wide at the mouth was met a little way beyond on the
left side. We noticed opposite that place a beautiful
spot for making a camp, but it was not a convenient
hour for us, and so we went along.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-71" id="Pg_2-71"></a>[<a href="images/2-71.png">71</a>]</span>
About 1,500 m. farther down a long narrow island
(200 m. long, 80 m. wide)&mdash;Gemma Island&mdash;heavily
wooded, was passed and admired. It had the usual
gravel spit on its southern or up-stream point, the
river in that particular spot flowing due north in a
perfectly straight line for 4,000 m. The island stood in
the centre of a basin 200 m. broad. There were <i>campos</i>
and <i>chapada</i> on the left bank.</p>

<p>We landed on the island, and found most beautifully
clean forest, nice and cool in the greenish dim light
which penetrated through the dense masses of foliage.
Particularly noticeable for their beauty were the handsome
large mimosas.</p>

<p>On the right bank of the river was forest with
plenty of rubber trees, but occasionally even on that
side patches of what the Brazilians call <i>serrad&atilde;o</i> (close
forest) were met with.</p>

<p>A hill range 120 ft. high formed a crescent from
west to north-west on the left side of the stream. A
kilometre and a half farther forest was to be seen on
the left side of the river; whereas on the right was
<i>chapada</i> and <i>campos</i>, quite open. A picturesque rocky
island, 15 m. in diameter, in laminated horizontal and
rich brown volcanic rock, rose 3 ft. above the water in
the centre of the stream. From that spot for 2 kil.
I noticed <i>chapada</i> on the right bank; then after that
was beautiful dense forest on both sides, with innumerable
vigorous rubber trees.</p>

<p>The river there was 200 m. wide and had shallow
water with strong <i>corrideiras</i> over enormous parallel
transverse dunes of sand and gravel which formed the
bottom. Islets of gravel were exposed, especially near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-72" id="Pg_2-72"></a>[<a href="images/2-72.png">72</a>]</span>
the left bank and in the centre, leaving only a more or
less navigable channel near the right bank.</p>

<p>We ran aground many a time along the 500 m. of
shallow water, varying from 6 in. to 3 ft. deep. We
emerged into a large basin 300 m. wide where eddies
of no great strength were formed. On the edge of
the beautiful basin we halted for our lunch, and to
take the usual astronomical observations at local noon.
We were in lat. 12&deg; 26&#8242;&middot;5 S.; long. 56&deg; 47&#8242; W.</p>

<p>I do not know if I have ever seen such swarms of
bees and butterflies as I saw at that place. They
seemed to swoop down upon us in myriads from all
sides. Taking the solar observations with the sextant
and artificial horizon, I endured positive torture with
the hundreds of bees which settled on my forehead,
nose and hands; while thousands of mosquitoes and
ants stung my legs, arms and face in those spots where
it was not possible to wrap myself up with towels.</p>

<p>It will be noticed in most of the photographs which
were taken along the river, and some of which illustrate
this book, that all my men have their heads wrapped
up. This was done as a protection against the
tantalizing insects. The temperature was warm; that
day, for instance, was 105&deg; F. in the sun and 86&deg; in
the shade.</p>

<p>We left again at 1.15, my men being&mdash;for a change&mdash;in
a good mood, owing to the amusing time we
always had fishing. We had been making excellent
progress during the last two or three days. The strange
man X enlivened our journey with diabolical songs
and with crude wit, which sent his companions into
fits of laughter. When they were in a merry mood or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-73" id="Pg_2-73"></a>[<a href="images/2-73.png">73</a>]</span>
excited, I noticed that they paddled along much
quicker and better, so I did not try to put a check to
the abominable language which would have jarred the
feelings of any one not born and bred in the interior of
Brazil.</p>

<p>It was quite interesting to me to find in that region
so much <i>chapada</i> and open country, as I had fully expected
to find thick forest all along. What struck me
particularly on the Arinos, and which I could not very
well explain, was that nearly invariably, when you
had thick forest on one side of the stream, you had
open country on the other, and only seldom noticed
either forest or campos on both sides of the stream at
the same time.</p>

<p>After passing <i>chapada</i> on the left bank we came to
a great many rocks just above water. A river 3 m.
wide entered the Arinos on the right side, and there
was to be seen an immense quantity of beautiful rubber
trees&mdash;as yet untouched by human being. The river
kept its width of 200 m. After going along <i>chapada</i>
on the left bank for some 3 kil., we came to magnificent
forest&mdash;this time on both sides&mdash;with a luxuriant
growth of rubber trees.</p>

<p>The scene, in its wonderful quietude, was most
impressive. It made one's heart bleed to think that
such rich land should lie unknown and unexploited in
these enlightened and enterprising days of the twentieth
century.</p>

<p>The sky above us was always interesting, with its
typical filaments of mist, their lengthy radiations faintly
marked upon the vivid blue of the sky vault and
making a centre in the north. These radiations were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-74" id="Pg_2-74"></a>[<a href="images/2-74.png">74</a>]</span>
in appearance not unlike giant ostrich feathers. They
were formed, I think, over the great streams which
flowed northwards into the Amazon.</p>

<p>We were troubled that day with numerous eddies
and shallow water, owing to the great width of the
river. Innumerable mounds of gravel rose in the centre
of the stream up to a few inches below the water level.</p>

<p>Another hill range, 100 ft. high, met that day was
crescent-shaped, the arc of a circle thus described being
from south-east by east to north-east.</p>

<p>The hill range on the north-east side of us was
eroded, exposing a red vertical wall 60 ft. high. A
small river 2 m. wide coming from the east entered the
Arinos on the right bank.</p>

<p>For 3,500 m. from that point the stream had an
average width of 250 m., and was really magnificent
with the wonderful cleanliness of the water&mdash;not the
slightest impurity, not a speck of wood or a leaf floating
upon its surface.</p>

<p>Fourteen kilometres of heavenly navigation&mdash;barring
X's language and the comments of his companions&mdash;and
we came to an ideal triangular island, 1,200 m.
long, 200 m. wide at its broadest point, with the
usual extensive gravel spit at its southern end&mdash;Victor
Emmanuel Island. The vegetation upon it
was too gorgeous for words, but there was no animal
life except insects.</p>

<p>Four kilometres farther a basin 300 m. in diameter
and from 1 to 6 ft. deep was crossed, in which a strong
<i>corrideira</i> was met. The navigable channel was in the
centre of the basin. A stream 10 m. wide, of most
beautiful crystalline water, which had its origin from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-75" id="Pg_2-75"></a>[<a href="images/2-75.png">75</a>]</span>
the south-west, threw itself into the Arinos on the left
side, some 2,000 m. below the basin.</p>

<p>From this point for 8 kil. the river flowed with a
slight deviation of 10&deg; in a northerly direction. The
left bank of the river was now quite open, with patches
of <i>chapada</i> and somewhat taller but still stunted vegetation
beyond; a thin row of tall trees lined the river
side. On the right bank was luxuriant forest, and
again plenty of beautiful rubber trees. Two islets of
gravel were next seen.</p>

<p>We were experiencing great difficulty in getting
suitable camping places at the right time when we
needed them. By 4.30, having come across a spot
which seemed suitable, we halted, having gone that
day 85 kil. 700 m.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> were still at an elevation of 1,100 ft. The water
was almost stagnant, and was evidently being held
up by some obstacle. I feared that we should soon
encounter nasty rapids. Watching the sky, I was
generally able to foretell what was ahead of us in the
river. In fact, a pretty mackerel sky, particularly to
the north-west, showed me that the water of our river
must be breaking up considerably, either in rapids or
waterfalls, in order to produce sufficient moisture in
the air to cause the accumulation of those cloudlets.
I always noticed that wherever there were heavy rapids
farther down clouds of more or less magnitude formed
directly above them at a comparatively low elevation,
and remained there owing to the perfect stillness of
the air.</p>

<p>On the night of July 14th the cold was felt intensely
by my men, the thermometer actually showing a
minimum of 38&deg; F.</p>

<p>During the night my men had a great excitement.
A large pachyderm, an <i>anta</i> (<i>Tapirus Americanus</i>) inquisitively
came in the midst of our camp. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-77" id="Pg_2-77"></a>[<a href="images/2-77.png">77</a>]</span>
evidently as much astonished at seeing us as we were
in discovering its presence. My men had been firing
their cartridges away during the day at rocks, at fish
in the river, and so on, so that when their rifles were
really needed the magazines were all empty, and gave
the <i>anta</i> plenty of time to hop away gracefully into the
darkness of the forest.</p>

<p>I had given orders to them to keep watch all night,
as a precaution against an attack from the Indians,
but my orders were, as usual, disobeyed. Personally,
I took the first watch every night, sitting up till 2 a.m.,
which time I occupied in writing up my notes, working
out computations of astronomical observations, classifying
the botanical and geological specimens collected
during the day, and replenishing my cameras with
new plates.</p>

<p>My men had eaten up all the supply of beans
(<i>feijao</i>) I had purchased at Diamantino, and therefore
even the cook could not be kept awake during the
night. The first rubber collector I had picked up when
coming down the Arinos was now our cook, and diabolical
indeed was his <i>cuisine</i>. Several times already
his life had been in danger from the angry attacks of
his companions, the quantities of pepper he sprinkled
on everything he cooked causing us all to cough sometimes
for half-hours at a time. He was very fond of
pepper himself, and could not understand why none
of us liked it.</p>

<p>During the night we still had a mackerel sky, covering
one-third of the sky vault, and a clear triangle of
mist, the apex of which was to the west, extending
towards the east, close upon the horizon line. When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-78" id="Pg_2-78"></a>[<a href="images/2-78.png">78</a>]</span>
we left in the morning at 7.30, we had <i>chapada</i> and
<i>campos</i> on the right bank and forest on the other side.
We had gone some 8&frac12; kil. from our camp when we
came to a hill range, 75 ft. high, on the right bank,
encircling the river with its thickly wooded slopes.
There was a tributary 25 m. wide, a most beautiful
stream, on the right bank. It came from 70&deg; b.m.
Its water was deliciously clear. Where it entered the
Arinos it had deposited a bank of crystals and
marble pebbles&mdash;yellow, red, and white&mdash;which in
the dazzling sun shone with great brilliancy at the
bottom of the river. Numberless rubber trees were to
be seen at that spot on the banks of the Arinos, and
also on those of this new important tributary.</p>

<p>Two kilometres farther, where the Arinos was 280 m.
wide, it looked just like a big lake of stagnant water.
The country was quite open on the left side, first
<i>chapada</i>, then <i>campos</i>.</p>

<p>By 9.30 a.m. we had a most wonderful display of
clouds and radiations of what looked like so many
mares' tales from the W.S.W. The river at that point
flowed for 1 kil. in a direction due south. We came
to a basin 300 m. across with a spit of white sand on
the north-west side. In this basin was an island&mdash;Nattal&igrave;
Island&mdash;200 m. long, 20 m. wide, 10 ft. above
water, with a fine beach of sand and gravel on the
south side. Gravel mounds were innumerable in the
centre of this stream.</p>

<p>After we had gone some 8 kil. farther down my
men shot an <i>ariranha</i>. They had a belief that these
<i>ariranhas</i> would easily kill a man in the water. As we
have already seen, they certainly had a great craving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-79" id="Pg_2-79"></a>[<a href="images/2-79.png">79</a>]</span>
for blood and were always brave in attacking. My men
called them "water leopards." In fact, the head of
the <i>ariranha</i> was not unlike the head of a cat or a
leopard. Although shot through the body two or
three times, the <i>ariranha</i> actually came thrice to the
attack of the canoe&mdash;so that my men were able to
seize it by the tail and pull it inside the canoe while it
was in a dying condition.</p>

<p>Sixteen kilometres farther down we came to another
beautiful tributary with delightfully clear water,
6 m. wide where it met the Arinos. One hundred
metres lower down another little tributary, only 4 m.
wide, also on the right bank, joined our stream. The
first tributary seemed to come from the north-east.
At the mouth of this tributary was a spot which would
have made a lovely halting place, but as it was too early
in the day we reluctantly went on in a north-westerly
direction, first for 4 kil., then north-east for 5 kil., passing
through a large basin 300 m. wide, containing two
islets, then passing charming sand-beaches, and farther
on another tributary, 8 m. wide, on the left of us, also
with deliciously clear water. When we proceeded on our
journey after lunch we found big rocks more frequent
in the stream, and went over a field of great boulders
just under the surface of the water that stretched half-way
across the shallow river.</p>

<p>Eight kilometres from our halting-place we came to
an extensive stony place with a strong rapid. One kilometre
beyond, a small tributary flowed into the Arinos
from the left side. On the left side we had a red and
brilliant yellow bank 70 ft. high, part of a small range
of hills which turned the river from N.N.W. to N.N.E.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-80" id="Pg_2-80"></a>[<a href="images/2-80.png">80</a>]</span>
Another small tributary 2 m. wide was seen on the left
side. Then, 4 kil. farther on, another tributary, also 2 m.
wide, and also on the left side, came from the south-west.
Three thousand six hundred metres beyond this,
we entered a basin 320 m. wide with an island 150 m.
long, including its gravel spit. Three more islands were
seen a little way beyond&mdash;Meraud, Tanis, and Loel
Islands, Meraud being the largest. Another island was
on the left of the river, leaving a passage 50 m. wide
on its west side. The group of islands was of alluvial
formation with deposits of gravel below.</p>

<p>The river in that region was too beautiful for words.
The foliage of the thick heavy forest on both sides was
densely green, the banks most tidy, and running in an
almost straight line for 10,000 m. During all that
distance the stream was 300 m. wide, and its speckless
water reflected with marvellous definition each leaf
and branch against the background of deep green.
Neat gravel banks occurred frequently in the shallow
water.</p>

<p>Some 300 m. down this long straight stretch of river
a tributary 8 m. wide, coming from 210&deg; b.m., threw
itself into the Arinos. Strong eddies were formed, as
many rocks were strewn in the centre of the stream.</p>

<p>One kilometre farther a conglomerate mass of
granite and yellow and red lava, with impurities embedded
in it, emerged just above the water in the centre
of the stream.</p>

<p>Another streamlet, 2 m. wide, and of wonderfully
limpid water, joined the Arinos on the right side. It
came from the north-east. Then another little streamlet
was seen on the left side.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-81" id="Pg_2-81"></a>[<a href="images/2-81.png">81</a>]</span>
At the end of 10 kil., where the river made a wide
angle from 330&deg; b.m. to 350&deg; b.m., and another straight
line of 4,000 m. stretched in front of us, we beheld a
huge submerged bank of sharp volcanic conglomerate
rock. In fact, we unexpectedly almost ran into it. Had
we done so at the rate at which we were travelling, our
canoe would certainly have been smashed to pieces
against the sharp-edged fractured rock&mdash;just as sharp
at the angles as the blades of knives.</p>

<p>Where the river turned once more from 350&deg; b.m.
to 320&deg; b.m. another small tributary appeared on the
right bank, and there a lot of handsome <i>mate</i> trees
(<i>Ilex paraguayensis</i>) seemed to flourish, and were certainly
pretty to look at.</p>

<p>Farther down we again came to <i>chapada</i> on the
left bank and heavy foliaged forest with a certain
number of rubber trees on the right bank. The left
bank, where it described a great sweeping circle, was
low and sandy, some 12 ft. above the level of the
river. Only a thin fringe of low trees grew there on
the edge of the water.</p>

<p>Six kilometres from the last tributary on the right
bank another streamlet, 3 m. wide, coming from the
S.S.W., cut its way through the left bank. Two thousand
five hundred metres farther on another tributary
20 m. wide&mdash;a deliciously beautiful stream&mdash;flowed
gracefully into the Arinos on the right side from the
north-east.</p>

<p>We made our camp at the junction of the two
streams. The camp was extremely bad. It was
already late in the evening and we could find no other
suitable spot. We had gone that day 83 kils. I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-82" id="Pg_2-82"></a>[<a href="images/2-82.png">82</a>]</span>
quite satisfied with the progress we had made during
the last few days. During the evening I made an
excursion on foot along the tributary river to the
north-east for several kilometres, but I found nothing of
particular interest.</p>

<p>During the night we received another visit from
an <i>anta</i>, but the pachyderm again escaped before my
men had time to kill it. We heard cries of Indians in
the distance. My men were in a great state of mind
for fear we should be attacked. I sat up the entire
night in order to be ready in case of emergency.</p>

<p>I took that opportunity of computing and checking
many of the astronomical observations I had taken,
and developing a great number of photographic glass
plates.</p>

<p>In my experience I have found that the fears
people have of spoiling negatives unless one is shut up
in an absolutely dark room are quite exaggerated.
On that particular occasion, for instance, and on many
previous and subsequent occasions, I developed the
glass plates&mdash;and I think with satisfactory results&mdash;out
in the open, with merely the fly-leaf of the tent
sheltering me overhead so as not to have the direct
rays of the stars shining upon the photographic plates.
Indeed, there was light enough coming in around the
tent for me to see quite plainly what was going on
outside. I simply covered up the developing trays as
an extra precaution, and seldom&mdash;in fact, never&mdash;spoiled
a negative in process of development.</p>

<p>I also found developing tanks quite serviceable
when a great number of negatives had to be developed
quickly. The red lamp necessary for photographic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-83" id="Pg_2-83"></a>[<a href="images/2-83.png">83</a>]</span>
work was invariably a great nuisance. I do not believe
that a compact, practical dark-room lamp has yet been
invented which is really serviceable to an explorer.
If it is a candle lamp the candle melts quickly in
those hot countries, producing an extra large flame
which generally cracks the red glass, and makes so
much smoke that the upper aperture becomes blocked
and puts the light out when you happen to be at the
most crucial point of your work.</p>

<p>The oil lanterns would be better, were it not for
the difficulty and messy nuisance of carrying and re-filling
the lamp each time with oil. Electric lights,
which are the only practical ones, of course are out of
the question when you have to be away for a year or
a year and a half, the storage batteries getting damaged
easily by damp and the innumerable accidents which
you have when exploring.</p>

<p>The greatest care had to be used in repacking the
developed glass plates. I owe to the care I took
of them that I was able to bring back 800 excellent
negatives out of 800 glass plates exposed.</p>

<p>The night was a little warmer than usual on
July 15th&mdash;minimum 53&deg; F. There was a heavy mist
over the river when we rose in the morning, and we
had to delay our departure until 7.30 a.m. When the
mist began to rise it hung about in beautiful curves
converging to a common radiating centre to the west.</p>

<p>During the night I had noticed a weird lunar effect&mdash;a
perfect cross of immense proportions intersecting the
crescent moon, which had a radiating halo surrounding
it.</p>

<p>Four thousand metres from our camp we came to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-84" id="Pg_2-84"></a>[<a href="images/2-84.png">84</a>]</span>
a tributary 3 m. wide on the left side of the river. It
came from the W.S.W. Near this a streamlet 1 m.
wide entered the Arinos on the right side, and another
streamlet of equal size farther down on the left bank.
There was fairly thin forest on both sides as we went
on, kilometre after kilometre, the water of the river
being almost stagnant in that part and heavy to paddle
along.</p>

<p>Five hundred metres down the straight stretch of
river, 4,000 m. long, we came to another charming
affluent, 10 m. wide, coming from the E.S.E. Farther
on, another tributary 2 m. wide entered the Arinos on
the left side, and formed a shallow bank of gravel extending
half-way across the stream.</p>

<p class="fsc">The Result of Half an Hour's Fishing on the Arinos-Juruena.</p>
<hr />
<p>As I have stated elsewhere, the mentality of
Brazilians was somewhat difficult to understand by
people of any other nation. They did everything the
wrong way, according to our notions. I had been
worried a great deal, the reader may remember, at the
most unpractical way in which my men loaded the
animals when I had my caravan of mules and horses.
I had been more than amazed at Brazilian ideas of
architecture, sculpture, painting and music. I had on
many occasions been dumbfounded at their ideas of
honour and truthfulness. Now once more I was sickly
amused&mdash;I had by then ceased to be amazed or dumbfounded
or angry&mdash;at the way my men daily packed
the baggage in the canoe. The baggage was naturally
taken out of the canoe every night when we made
our camp, for the canoe leaked so badly that
when we arrived anywhere and halted we had to
beach her, or else, where this was not possible,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-85" id="Pg_2-85"></a>[<a href="images/2-85.png">85</a>]</span>
we found her in the morning almost entirely submerged.
Naturally we invariably selected shallow
places where we could bale the water out and float her
again.</p>

<p>Returning to the baggage: the men every morning
insisted on loading the canoe in front, where the four
men were situated paddling, and the three dogs of
the expedition were also accommodated. I sat in the
centre of the canoe, and Alcides at the helm naturally
stood in the stern. The man whose incessant daily
occupation it was to bale out the water of course had
to be with the group of four men in the bow, since, the
canoe being so heavily weighted at that end, the water
found its way down there.</p>

<p>Now, loading the canoe in such a fashion, at the
bow, had the double drawback of causing a greater
resistance against the water, and therefore nearly
doubling the work of the men in paddling. Then again,
when we ran aground or struck a rock, the impact was
more severe on the canoe&mdash;not to speak of the difficulty
of getting her off again. The steering, too, was also
much more difficult with the stern of the canoe so far
out of the water.</p>

<p>I pointed out the mistake to my men, but it was no
use arguing, and they refused to follow my advice.
Like all ignorant people, they thought they knew
everything better than anybody else, and as, in a way,
they were the chief sufferers for their own conceit, I
thought I would avoid unpleasantness and let them
do things their own way as long as we kept going forward
on our journey.</p>

<p>Alcides, too, who by now had become imbued with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-86" id="Pg_2-86"></a>[<a href="images/2-86.png">86</a>]</span>
the idea that he was as good a navigator as Christopher
Columbus or Vasco da Gama, had the strangest notions
of navigation. He never avoided grounding the canoe
on every bank he saw; he never avoided dashing the
canoe into every rock which stood or did not stand
in our way. I never could understand exactly why
he did that, except for the mischievous pleasure he
derived from giving the men who were sitting at the
other end of the canoe a violent bump, which often
rolled them over altogether.</p>

<p>When we left Goyaz my men insisted on purchasing
life-belts in case we should be travelling by
water. As only one of the Goyaz men could swim,
I had gladly given them the money to purchase those
articles. On our first day of navigation the men
amused me very much, as they all appeared garbed in
their life-belts, as if we had been going to the rescue of
a stranded ship in a tempest. I laughed heartily at
the sight. The intense heat of the sun made the heavy
cork belts so uncomfortable for them, that they discarded
them when they saw that the canoe would
actually float on the water, and packed them away
inside a wooden box, which they then screwed down
tight. The belts remained in that box most of the time,
except one day when a man put one on, as I had given
him instructions to go some way off in the centre of
the stream where the current was rather swift. By
misadventure he lost his footing, and had we not been
quick in going to his rescue he certainly would have
been drowned.</p>

<p>We tested the life-belts, and I found that not only
would they not float after they had been a minute or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-87" id="Pg_2-87"></a>[<a href="images/2-87.png">87</a>]</span>
two in the water, but they became so heavy when
soaked with moisture that they would have dragged
to the bottom even a fair swimmer. They were
evidently old discarded ship belts. The cork, enclosed
in a canvas cover, had got decomposed and
pulverized, and therefore rendered useless.</p>

<p>As we are referring to the strange ways of looking
at things by different nations, I might as well include
the endless arguments I had with my men in selecting
our camps. I naturally always selected the cleanest
spots with a flat ground, so that the tents could be
pitched satisfactorily without extra trouble, where
there was little vegetation, and where the water was
good. My men always quarrelled over this, and insisted
on stopping in the filthiest places, either where
some trees, rotted away, had fallen down, where the
vegetation on the edge of the river needed cutting,
and where the ground had to be levelled before I could
pitch my camp bed. They always preferred sleeping
under the stifling vegetation to where there was an
open space and we had the clear sky over us.</p>

<p>They all slept in hammocks&mdash;the favourite resting
arrangement of the Brazilian&mdash;to my mind the most
uncomfortable and absurd fashion of resting, especially
in tropical regions. First of all, it is almost an impossibility
to assume a perfectly horizontal position for
your entire body, except&mdash;if you are an expert&mdash;diagonally;
then there is always a certain amount of
swing and you are likely to tumble over at any moment;
you can never keep the blankets in position, and you
expose your entire body to the stings of the mosquitoes,
flies and other insects, and of the ants which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-88" id="Pg_2-88"></a>[<a href="images/2-88.png">88</a>]</span>
crawl into your hammock by hundreds from the trees
in which they swarm. It was not uncommon when
we camped to hear during the night a crash,
followed immediately after by oaths. The tree to
which one of the hammocks had been fastened had
suddenly broken and let the man down with a bump.
Then again, the mischievous ants took the greatest
delight during the night in cutting the strings of the
hammocks, and on several occasions my followers had
nasty falls. Yet the Brazilians swear by hammocks.</p>

<p>Another stream 2 m. wide, coming from the north,
entered the Arinos on the right bank. A number of
<i>ariranhas</i>, attracted by the vivid red of the British
flag which was flying at the stern of the canoe, followed
us for some time and came courageously to the attack,
showing their teeth fiercely at us and snarling frantically.
Entire families of those delightful little creatures
were seen, and they invariably gave us a similar
hearty greeting. They followed us sometimes for
hundreds and hundreds of metres, and became most
excited when I took the flag and waved it at them,
and sometimes placed it near the water in order to
drive them frantic.</p>

<p>We now had most beautiful forest on both sides.
A stream 5 m. wide joined the Arinos on the left side
from the west, forming a charming little waterfall as
it entered the main stream. A little farther on the
right was another streamlet, coming from the south-east.
Generally, as in this case, when we reached
tributary streams of any importance, gravel banks extended
and blocked a great part of, sometimes even
half, the main stream.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-89" id="Pg_2-89"></a>[<a href="images/2-89.png">89</a>]</span>
A picturesque stream, 8 m. wide, coming from the
north-east, was then reached on the right side. It
flowed through a rocky gate. Five or six kilometres
farther on a tiny streamlet dribbled into the Arinos,
and also another, 1 m. wide, on the left bank.</p>

<p>At noon that day the sky was extraordinarily interesting.
From the north-west extended a wonderful
succession of loop coils of transparent mist, giving the
sky the appearance of a peacock's extended tail.</p>

<p>Just before we halted for lunch we came to a charming
streamlet of delicious water, 2 m. wide, on the
right bank.</p>

<p>The days were getting warmer as we advanced
farther north. It was hot work sitting in the sun&mdash;105&deg;
F. that day&mdash;to take observations for latitude
and longitude. In the shade the thermometer registered
89&deg; F. Lat. 12&deg; 21&#8242;&middot;3 S.; long. 57&deg; 16&#8242; W.</p>

<p>After lunch, 2&frac12; kil. from our camp, we passed on
the left bank a delightful tributary coming from the
W.S.W. Its mouth was 8 m. wide, and poured forth
waters of the most beautiful emerald green.</p>

<p>Five hundred metres farther down another large
tributary, 30 m. wide, coming from the north-east, was
observed on the right bank. Farther still, the river
formed a large basin 300 m. wide. Lovely forest flourished
round the sweeping curve of the basin. There
was simply a solid mass of marvellously fresh foliage,
with hardly a break through which, it seemed, a human
being could pass. In that particular part the leaves
came right down to the water, but there was no reason
to suppose that they grew equally low inland.</p>

<p>The stream, which was 250 m. broad, showed farther<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-90" id="Pg_2-90"></a>[<a href="images/2-90.png">90</a>]</span>
on an immense bank of gravel 700 m. long, which
rose above the surface in the shape of two long
islands&mdash;one 300 m., the other 400 m. in length.</p>

<p>We felt the heat considerably going down the river,
as we were always in the sun in the centre of the
stream, with a temperature seldom less than 105&deg; F.
Especially where thick forest was on both sides of us,
there seemed to be no air close to the water. When
we came to patches of chapada and open country we
could breathe a little better. Several were the tributary
streamlets to which we came that afternoon.
First we saw one rivulet, 1 m. wide, on the right bank,
then 13 kil. 500 m. farther on another affluent, 3 m.
wide, coming from the north-east, also on the right
bank; then 1,500 m. farther a rivulet &frac12; m. wide,
coming from the south-west (left bank); then 4,500 m.
farther a charming stream, 6 m. wide, coming from the
north, and meeting with the Arinos near an extensive
stony place with shallow and troublesome water. Strong
eddies formed at that spot. One more streamlet, 1 m.
wide, was reached that day on the right. It came from
the north-east.</p>

<p>The river had that day flowed almost continuously
in directions varying from north-west to north, barring
two sections where its course had been 10&deg; east of
north.</p>

<p>After passing the last tributary the river described
a sweeping curve, gradually turning so far back as to
flow in a south-westerly (240&deg; b.m.) direction.</p>

<p>There was there shallow water with gravel banks in
the centre of the stream. Curiously enough, we did not
notice so much rubber close to the river in that region,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-91" id="Pg_2-91"></a>[<a href="images/2-91.png">91</a>]</span>
but in an excursion a short distance from the water
we came upon <i>Siphonia elastica</i> trees, not only along
the Arinos but also along the tributaries.</p>

<p>We halted that day at sunset, having gone 73 kil.
400 m.; which, although much less than the previous
days, was still fair going for us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> night of July 16th was heavy, the thermometer
registering a minimum temperature of 62&deg;F. We
had great fun fishing during the early hours of the
night. In the morning we had hundreds of pounds of
fish spread upon the bank of the river, with many
excellent specimens of the <i>motimchun</i> fish&mdash;so called, I
believe, because of its noisy and rebellious habits.</p>

<p>The sky was overladen with clouds, and the west
showed radiations of light. We had gone 2,500 m.
from our camp when we came to a tributary stream on
the left side coming from the south. Four thousand
four hundred metres farther on, a hill-range 120 ft.
high, with heavy forest upon it, encircled a sweeping
curve on the left of us to the west and north-west. The
cliff of this range, eroded by the river, showed rock of
a vivid red right up to its highest point, laminated in
perfectly horizontal layers, each 10 ft. thick. Farther
on a great basin 350 m. wide and of great beauty had
formed.</p>

<p>Some 10 kil. beyond a beautiful beach of white
sand was noticeable on the left bank. We were always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-93" id="Pg_2-93"></a>[<a href="images/2-93.png">93</a>]</span>
glad to see these beaches, as we frequently found on
them quantities of tortoise eggs&mdash;most delicious to eat.</p>

<p>An island&mdash;Gabriella Island&mdash;200 m. long divided
the river into two channels, the larger one of which&mdash;200
m. wide&mdash;we followed; the other being but 30 m.
broad and much strewn with rocks. The river, from
the point where we met the sand beach, flowed in a
S.S.W. direction for 6,500 m., when it gradually resumed
its course northward. The island, thickly
wooded, was extremely beautiful, with trees of great
size upon it. Quantities of <i>ariranhas</i> were to be found
near this island, and they came straight for us with
their mouths open, shrieking wildly and snarling and
spitting like cats. I was always amazed at their
bravery, as they came right on while being shot at by
my men, the reports of the rifles enraging them to
absolute frenzy.</p>

<p>Shortly after we came to another most beautiful,
oval-shaped island, 350 m. long&mdash;Maude Island&mdash;in a
basin extending from east to west for a breadth of not
less than 500 m.</p>

<p>Another island&mdash;Vera Island&mdash;150 m. long and of
an elongated shape, was seen in the same basin. It
also had luxuriant vegetation upon it, whereas, curiously
enough, the banks on either side of the great basin
showed <i>chapada</i> with stunted trees. Farther on, where
a small tributary entered the Arinos on the left side,
the country seemed quite open beyond the narrow
fringe of trees along the water.</p>

<p>Another streamlet 3 m. wide flowed into the Arinos
from the north-east on the right bank. The main river
there was of a width of 400 m.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-94" id="Pg_2-94"></a>[<a href="images/2-94.png">94</a>]</span>
Another great island&mdash;Luiz Schnoor Island&mdash;also
most beautiful, like the others, was next seen. We
halted on it for our midday meal, and to take the usual
astronomical observations. The sky had, by that
time, become beautifully clear, of a dense cobalt blue,
and I was able to take twenty-three sights of the sun.
I generally took a great many sights with the sextant
and artificial horizon, in order to define the latitude
and longitude with greater accuracy. We were then
in lat. 11&deg; 38&#8242;&middot;4 S.; long. 57&deg; 35&#8242; W.</p>

<p>Gorgeous <i>gamelleira</i> or <i>figueira</i> trees (<i>ficus</i>) were to
be seen on that island, standing high up upon arches
formed by vigorous roots. In a way the lower part of
those <i>figueiras</i> resembled a huge octopus, the branches
being extremely contorted as they clung to the ground
in order to support the weight of the giant tree of
which they made part. One could easily walk under
the tree among the roots and still have six or eight feet
of space left above one's head.</p>

<p>As I went round to explore the island while my
men were cooking the dinner, I discovered a small lake
in the centre of the island&mdash;a most poetic spot, with
its neat, delightful vegetation all round it reflected as
in a mirror in the golden waters which reproduced in
a deeper tone the rich sunset tints of the sky above. I
sat myself down to look at the beautiful scene. The
poetry vanished at once. There were millions of
ants which swarmed all over me the moment I sat
down upon the ground, and bit me with such fury that
I had to remove my clothes in the greatest haste and
jump into the water. That raised a cloud of mosquitoes,
which made it most uncomfortable for me when I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-95" id="Pg_2-95"></a>[<a href="images/2-95.png">95</a>]</span>
came out again and was busy searching for ants in my
clothes.</p>

<p>My men killed a beautiful long-armed spider monkey.
I was sorry, as I had watched the wonderful jumps of
this animal from one tree to another. Using the impetus
of the swing which they could obtain from the
immense length of their arms, as well as the swing of
the branch on which they were hanging, they could
fly enormous distances through the air. The span
from hand to hand in proportion to the size of the body
was really amazing.</p>

<p>Luiz Schnoor Island was 450 m. long. Plenty of
rubber trees were to be seen on the right bank of the
river after passing this great island, especially where
the river described a large sweeping curve towards the
north-east.</p>

<p>Farther on, close to the right bank, an island 100 m.
long and 5 ft. high, of yellow sand and gravel, showed
brilliantly with its vivid colouring upon the blue waters
of the river. For identification' sake I named it Gravel
Island on the map I was making of the river. I seemed
to be in fairyland&mdash;but for the company of my men&mdash;as
I floated down the stream, there 400 m. wide.</p>

<p>We had gone hardly 4 kil. when we came to another
ideal island&mdash;Margherita Island&mdash;400 m. long and
200 m. wide, with magnificent trees upon it. A
small stream joined the Arinos on the left side. Lower
down stream we had thin forest on both sides, with
some remarkable <i>oleo</i> trees, with their minute grey
leaves and the branches, laden with red berries,
drooping&mdash;weeping-willow-like&mdash;right down in the water.</p>

<p>Next we came to sand and gravel banks with islets<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-96" id="Pg_2-96"></a>[<a href="images/2-96.png">96</a>]</span>
1 ft. high emerging from the water in the centre of the
river, all those little islets displaying verdant grass on
their southern side and pure white sand on the northern
side.</p>

<p>The river was at that point flowing in a N.N.E.
direction. Then came a long straight line of 6,000 m.
of river flowing to 305&deg; b.m. About half-way through
this long stretch the stream divided into two large
arms, one in direct continuation of the above bearings,
the other in a curve, encircling an island 1,000 m.
broad. The basin&mdash;as still as a lake&mdash;in which this
island was situated was not less than 1,500 m. across.
The island&mdash;Charles Landor Island&mdash;was 2,000 m. in
length. It had plenty of rubber trees upon it, and
plenty were to be seen also on the banks. We went
some 8 or 10 kil. farther that night, and at five o'clock
we halted, having made poor progress that day&mdash;only
60 kil.</p>

<p>Immense quantities of fish could be seen in the
river. No sooner had we made camp than we got
out lines and hooks of all sizes, which we baited with
pieces of <i>toucinho</i>. One end of the bigger lines we
made fast to trees, as the fish we often caught were so
powerful that on several occasions they had dragged
us into the water and we lost not only the fish but the
line as well. We had great sport that night and caught
quantities of <i>trahira</i> (<i>Macradon trahira</i>)&mdash;not unlike a
giant salmon and quite as good to eat; and also some
<i>surubim</i> (<i>Platystoma Lima</i>), a large fish belonging to the
herring family. The surubim was flat-headed, and
not unlike the pintado fish which I have described in a
previous chapter. It had thin scales over the body,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-97" id="Pg_2-97"></a>[<a href="images/2-97.png">97</a>]</span>
and an abnormally powerful lower jaw, with vicious-looking,
sharply-pointed teeth on the edge of the upper
and lower lip. These curiously situated teeth were far
apart, and so firmly inserted in the hard lips that it
took a violent blow to remove them.</p>

<p>Although after a few minutes we had killed fish
enough to last us&mdash;had we been able to preserve it&mdash;for
some weeks, my men sat up the greater part of the
night hauling quantities to the bank. The excitement
each time a fish 80 or 100 lb. in weight was hauled out
of the water was considerable. The wild yells and exquisite
language whenever one of my men was dragged
into the water kept me awake the entire night.</p>

<p>We left that camp at 7.30 on July 17th, the minimum
temperature having been 66&deg; F. during the night.
Heavy globular clouds covered the entire sky. We
were then in a region extraordinarily rich in rubber;
quantities of <i>Siphonia elastica</i> trees were to be seen.
It made one's heart bleed to think that nobody was
there to collect the riches of that wonderful land.</p>

<p>The river flowed in short sections from north-west
to north-north-east, barring a long stretch of 4,000 m.,
when we came to a great basin 600 m. wide, with two
large islands in it; the eastern island&mdash;Orlando Island&mdash;being
100 m. wide, the western&mdash;Elizabeth Chimay
Island&mdash;220 m. broad and not less than 500 m. long.
South of both these islands were islets of gravel 50 m.
each in diameter.</p>

<p>Nine thousand five hundred metres below these
islands an important tributary, 8 m. wide, flowed into
the Arinos from the right bank. It came from the
south-east. Close to the left bank, from which it had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-98" id="Pg_2-98"></a>[<a href="images/2-98.png">98</a>]</span>
been separated by the current, leaving a channel only
5 m. wide, another island&mdash;Isabel Island&mdash;300 m. long
was found.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards we came to a big equilateral-triangular
island&mdash;Armida Island&mdash;fully 1 kil. a side.
Albert Island, next to it, was of a narrow elongated shape.</p>

<p>From the beginning of Armida Island the river flowed
for 4,000 m. in a direct line to 310&deg; b.m. Four large
rocks in a cluster stood in the centre of the stream at
the north-north-westerly end of the island. Then we
had another stretch of 4,300 m., during which the river
was squeezed through a narrow neck, 100 m. wide, between
low rocks. Immediately afterwards we emerged
into a bay 800 m. broad, with three islets on one side of
it. They were rather dry and somewhat mean-looking.
I called them Faith, Hope, and Charity Islands.</p>

<p>After that the river was 800 m. wide. A deposit
of gravel some 300 m. long was exposed on the right
side beyond the last island of the group.</p>

<p>Three kilometres farther we halted for an hour or
so, just time enough for me to take the latitude and
longitude and for our lunch to be cooked. The usual
torture had to be endured from the innumerable insects.
The heat was also terrible&mdash;107&deg; F. in the sun, 93&deg;
in the shade. Lat. 11&deg; 23&#8242;&middot;9 S.; long. 57&deg; 39&#8242; W.</p>

<p>When we left, we saw 3,500 m. beyond our halting
place, beside a great heap of rocks on the left side of the
river, a rivulet, 3 m. wide, entering the Arinos on the
left.</p>

<p>From that spot the river was contracted from a
width of 800 m. to one of only 120 m. Naturally the
water was of great depth and the current swift.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-99" id="Pg_2-99"></a>[<a href="images/2-99.png">99</a>]</span>
Two great volcanic rocks stuck out in the centre
of the stream, and two extensive heaps of volcanic
rock stood on the right side of us, the rocks being at all
angles in a confused mass. Where these rocks were&mdash;a
spot which my men called the "porteira" or gateway&mdash;the
river turned sharply from 70&deg; b.m. to 290&deg; b.m.
The water seemed almost stagnant there, and we had
to make a great effort to get on. It seemed as if
there had been an undercurrent pushing us back.
The water was surely held up by some obstacle, and I
feared we had at last reached the extensive rapids
which I had expected for some days. Rocks were to
be seen in abundance all along, and three more sets of
giant boulders were reached, one after the other, in the
centre of the river, there only 150 m. broad. Strange
heaps of broken-up boulders of immense size were to
be seen on the right bank; then farther on more great
heaps in confusion on the left bank.</p>

<p>A tiny rivulet found its way among the rocks on
the right side. The channel was much strewn with
dangerous submerged rocks. I thought I would take
the navigation into my own hands for a little while,
and found a comparatively easy channel on the left
side of the river close to the bank.</p>

<p>As I had expected, the rumbling noise of troubled
waters was getting louder and louder, and the whitish
mist which rose above the horizon line was an unmistakable
sign that we had come to a dangerous spot.
Soon after, in fact, we arrived at a large circular
basin, some 600 m. in diameter, with rocks in the
centre of it. Two clusters of magnificent rocks, 30 ft.
high, towered on the left side of the river. Then came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-100" id="Pg_2-100"></a>[<a href="images/2-100.png">100</a>]</span>
a long row of rocks, also gigantic, and a sandy beach
which had accumulated against them. A little farther
another great mass of rocks in disorder stood up against
the now once more fierce current.</p>

<p>We made our way tentatively along what seemed to
us the safest channel, to 320&deg; b.m., and with trepidation
shot the rapids, which were quite fearsome. I
must say for my men that by now they had acquired
a certain amount of courage&mdash;courage, like all things,
being a matter of training after all. We went down
at a terrific speed amidst the splashing waters, shaving
dangerous rocks and escaping collision by miracle.
When we got to the bottom of the rapid we were shot
into the whirlpool, which we might have avoided with
ease had Alcides obeyed the orders I shouted to him.</p>

<p>When I had shot the rapids before in other countries,
I had always avoided getting into the centre of
the whirlpool; but Alcides, who had never navigated a
river before, held the contrary idea, and always insisted
on steering the canoe right into the centre of those
dangerous rotating waters.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill2-100a.jpg"><img src="images/ill2-100a_th.jpg" alt="Whirlpool at End of Rapid." title="Whirlpool at End of Rapid." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Whirlpool at End of Rapid.</p>

<p class="fsc">In Shallow Water.</p>
<hr />
<p>It was sufficient to remonstrate as I did, for Alcides
to do a thing over and over again with the persistency
of a mule, in order to maintain what he thought was his
<i>amour-propre</i>. As it was, on that occasion, the canoe
swerved round with such force that she nearly turned
over, and got so filled with water that we had to struggle
out of the difficulty as best we could and beach her, or
she would have sunk.</p>

<p>At that point an island 400 m. long and 50 m.
wide divided the river into two channels. The western
channel had a small island of white sand and many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-101" id="Pg_2-101"></a>[<a href="images/2-101.png">101</a>]</span>
rocks on its southern side. Pretty yellow flowers grew
wherever a little earth had accumulated upon the rocks.</p>

<p>After going 1,800 m. we found a great basin 600 m.
wide with a rocky island and barrier right across it.</p>

<p>Farther on innumerable rocks of all sizes could be
seen on the left bank; and 1,500 m. beyond these, where
a solid rock rose in the centre of the stream, eddies of
wonderful power were produced in the stream.</p>

<p>We glanced at a magnificent island of rock on the
left side as we sped along swiftly with the current;
but we were so busy with the difficult navigation,
and expecting accidents at any moment&mdash;what else
could I expect with the disobedient, unpractical,
obstinate crew I had with me?&mdash;that I had not much
time to admire the picturesqueness of the scenery.</p>

<p>I had quite foreseen that it was impossible to
avoid disaster sooner or later, so that all I could do
was to think of which would be the best way to minimize
its effects, when it did come.</p>

<p>In the great circular basin which was formed in
the river there was a passage to the west, which I did
not like at all, so I ordered my men to follow the
passage to the north-east. We met there violent
eddies which knocked the canoe about in a most alarming
manner soon after we had descended a short rapid
of some steepness.</p>

<p>Our baggage was simply soaked owing to the
amount of water we had shipped on various occasions
during the day. We saw ahead of us, only a short
distance off, a rapid of some magnitude. We decided
to halt at four o'clock in order that we might go and
explore on foot along the bank and see whether the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-102" id="Pg_2-102"></a>[<a href="images/2-102.png">102</a>]</span>
canoe could be navigated down, or if we had better
unload her and let her down with ropes. We cut a
space in the forest, which was there thick, in order to
make our camp. We spread all our things to dry
during the night. The air was stifling&mdash;we had a
minimum temperature of 73&deg; F. (July 18th).</p>

<p>I took the accurate elevation of the camp with the
hypsometrical apparatus, water boiling at that spot at
210&deg;&middot;4, with the temperature of the air 73&deg; F.; altitude
1,113 ft. above sea level. I also took observations
for latitude and longitude: Lat. 11&deg; 17&#8242;&middot;5 S.; long.
57&deg; 37&#8242; W. We had to remain the entire morning in
order to cut a way through the forest and take part
of the most valuable baggage on men's backs until a
point below the rapids was reached.</p>

<p>We named that place Camp Jahu, as we caught
there several enormous fish of that name.</p>

<p>In a reconnaissance we made we found that from
Camp Jahu we had to take the canoe along among
innumerable rocks scattered in the only navigable
channel on the north side of a basin 700 m. wide, with
a large island 350 m. wide&mdash;Sarah Island&mdash;on the
southern side of the bay, and another smaller island
almost in the centre of the basin. There was a drop
2 ft. high&mdash;a regular step&mdash;in a barrier of sharply-pointed
rocks. We had some two hours' hard work
in order to get the canoe safely down. The rocks were
so close together that we could not find a passage large
enough for the canoe, and we actually had to pull her
out of the water over some rocks and then let her
down gently on the other side.</p>

<p>After leaving that great <i>pedraria</i> there was a clear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-103" id="Pg_2-103"></a>[<a href="images/2-103.png">103</a>]</span>
basin 250 m. wide, ending where two enormous heaps
of rock formed a giant gateway. An island, 80 m.
wide&mdash;Rebecca Island&mdash;was found near the left cluster
of rocks. Another small island had formed close to
the right of the river. We descended by the north-easterly
passage, only 4 m. wide, where the current
was extremely swift but the rapid comparatively easy
to negotiate.</p>

<p>We then followed the channel flowing to 350&deg; b.m.,
and after passing innumerable rocks made our camp
again before coming to a large rapid which we heard
rumbling in that direction.</p>

<p>We had worked hard all that day, and all the progress
we had made by sunset was a distance of 2,000 m.&mdash;or
a little more than one mile.</p>

<p>Alcides, Antonio and I immediately proceeded to
cut a trail through the forest from that point down to
the end of the rapid, 1,200 m. farther down. Then we
proceeded to take all the baggage upon our shoulders&mdash;a
task which occupied several hours. I was greatly
surprised to find that the men did this willingly enough,
although they were unaccustomed to carrying and the
loads were heavy. They laughed heartily at one
another as they struggled under the heavy weights, or
trod upon thorns, or were jerked about with knocking
against trees&mdash;the passage we had cut being necessarily
not spacious.</p>

<p>I had not seen my men so jolly for a long time&mdash;in
fact, I do not remember ever having seen them so
jolly. I was in hopes that this state of affairs might
last, as it was certainly not pleasant to be travelling
in such usually morose company.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-104" id="Pg_2-104"></a>[<a href="images/2-104.png">104</a>]</span>
During the night we caught an immense jahu,
weighing over 50 lb., as well as some 200 lb. of
smaller fish. As the bank of the stream was rather
high and steep, we had a great deal of trouble to land
the larger fish safely. Some of my men had exciting
experiences, one man falling into the water on receiving
a powerful blow from the tail of the struggling jahu.
The scene was a comic one, the terror of the man being
amusing to watch.</p>

<p>We carried a great quantity of salt; with it
my men set out to preserve the best portions of the
fish we had caught&mdash;a precaution of which I fully
approved.</p>

<p>I noticed that whenever we came across rocky
places the number of insects increased to an enormous
extent, especially mosquitoes and gnats. I think it was
due principally to the fact that in those rocks many
cavities were found which got filled with stagnant
water which eventually became putrefied.</p>

<p>The place where we halted we called Abelha Camp,
because of the millions of bees which worried us to
death there, not to speak of the swarms of flies, mosquitoes
and ants, and myriads of butterflies which came
to settle in swarms upon us. It was indeed curious
to note the wonderful tameness of the latter, as they
had never seen a human being before.</p>

<p class="fsc">Fish of the Arinos River.</p>
<hr />
<p>There was a nasty-looking rapid close to the camp.
We had to let the empty canoe down carefully by
means of ropes, my men on that particular occasion
donning their lifebelts again, although they walked on
dry land when they were taking the canoe along.
When I asked them why they put them on, they said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-105" id="Pg_2-105"></a>[<a href="images/2-105.png">105</a>]</span>
that perhaps the canoe might drag them into the
water and they had no wish to get drowned.</p>

<p>We left that camp late in the afternoon&mdash;at three
o'clock&mdash;having wasted the entire morning conveying
the canoe to a spot of safety and then carrying all the
baggage along overland.</p>

<p>After having gone some 2 kil. farther we came to
another rapid and a <i>pedraria</i> with nasty rocks right
across the channel, the only passage I could see possible
for our canoe being in the centre of the stream.
That channel was only a few metres wide, and had
in the centre of it a large rock just under the surface,
which flung the water up in the air. We just managed
to shoot that rapid safely, although with trembling
hearts.</p>

<p>Farther down, rocks innumerable, rising only two
or three feet above water, spread half-way across the
channel from the right side. Then rapids and strong
eddies were encountered. For 700 m. the river showed
foliated rock strewn all along on both banks, and great
volcanic boulders of a more rounded shape. The foliation
showed a dip westward of 45&deg;.</p>

<p>We were delighted when we discovered in that
region many <i>solveira</i> or <i>sorveira</i> trees, or milk trees,
exuding when incised milk most delicious to drink.
Then there were plenty of <i>figueiras</i> or <i>gameilleiras</i> and
wild bananas. We wasted much time extracting milk
from the <i>solveiras</i> and eating wild fruit.</p>

<p>Monkeys were to be seen in that part. They seemed
most astonished on perceiving us, and came quite close,
gazing at us in the most inquisitive manner.</p>

<p>We felt that we had come to a real heaven on earth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-106" id="Pg_2-106"></a>[<a href="images/2-106.png">106</a>]</span>
except for the river, which could have given points to
the River Styx of infernal fame.</p>

<p>When we returned to the canoe we found obstructions
of all kinds in the stream. Small rapid succeeded
small rapid. Rocky islets and scattered rocks rendered
navigation complicated.</p>

<p>Where the river turned sharply to the N.N.E. another
dangerous rapid was reached, with rocks scattered
all over the channel, some just submerged. We tried
to shoot that rapid on the east side, but we got badly
stuck on a submerged rock, and once more the canoe
filled with water. It took us the best part of an hour
to extricate ourselves from our uncomfortable position.</p>

<p>A beautiful island 400 m. long and 200 m. wide&mdash;Maria
Island&mdash;was then reached. It had a long spur
of white sand at its south-easterly end, and pretty
vegetation upon it. Strange domes of rock were near
by, one particular dome of great size showing a spit
of white sand 70 m. long, on its north-westerly side.
Many other islets of rock rose above the water along the
bank of the larger island, while rapids of some magnitude
existed at the end of the island.</p>

<p>We hardly ever came to a stretch of placid water.
No sooner had we left the last rapid than, the river
turning sharply at that point, we went over a strong
<i>corrideira</i>, so strewn with obstacles that in the terrific
current we had a narrow escape of having our unmanageable,
long canoe smashed against one of the
innumerable rocks.</p>

<p>As we went on at a great speed I had just time to
notice rocks of all sizes and shapes along both banks,
and strange rocks in the middle of the river, one or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-107" id="Pg_2-107"></a>[<a href="images/2-107.png">107</a>]</span>
two of them with stunted trees growing in fissures
which had become filled with earth.</p>

<p>Another island, 300 m. long&mdash;Martia Island&mdash;with a
picturesque spur of rock at its south-easterly end, was
next reached as we were going swiftly down a <i>corrideira</i>
in the channel to the right which we were following.</p>

<p>After the <i>corrideira</i>, as I was busy writing a description
of the landscape, I was thrown off my seat. My
men also had a similar experience, the canoe nearly
turning turtle and becoming filled with water. Alcides
had steered us right into the centre of a whirlpool.</p>

<p>These unexpected baths were not much to my taste&mdash;not
so much for the discomfort they caused my person,
as for the trouble they gave me in protecting my
notebooks and instruments. Also, in these accidents
we lost a considerable amount of our supply of salt,
which melted away in the water, and the supply of
flour and rice suffered from these unnecessary immersions.</p>

<p>A channel 30 m. wide separated Martia Island from
a second island&mdash;Camilla Island&mdash;100 m. long, which
must once certainly have formed part of it, but which
had been separated by the eroding waters of the stream.
Both islands were wooded, and were extremely pretty.
Great heaps of rock, 20 m. in diameter and even
more, occupied the centre of the stream after we had
passed the last island.</p>

<p>We had only gone 12 kil. 300 m. that day, so difficult
had been the navigation.</p>

<p>During the night in less than one hour we caught
two large <i>jahu</i>, one huge <i>pacu</i> (<i>Prochilodus argentius</i>),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-108" id="Pg_2-108"></a>[<a href="images/2-108.png">108</a>]</span>
the latter shaped like a sole, but of a much greater size,
and with brilliant red patches on its body&mdash;a most
delicately-tasting fish to eat&mdash;and a number of large
<i>trahira</i> (<i>Machrodon trahira</i>), also called by the Brazilians
<i>rubaffo</i> because of the noise they make in the water.
Altogether over 200 lb. of fish were got out of the
water in less than sixty minutes.</p>

<p>We found many <i>jenipapeiros</i> (or <i>genipapeiro</i>) trees,
from the stewed bark of which we made excellent tea.
Its fruit was good to eat, and we used it for making
sweets.</p>

<p>During the night of July 19th the minimum temperature
was 67&deg; F.</p>

<p>We started off gaily enough in the morning, passing
first a great boulder, 10 m. in diameter, sticking right
out of the water; then an island 200 m. long contained
in a basin 500 m. wide. We left the island&mdash;Ruby
Island&mdash;which was 80 m. long, on our left, and went
down a channel with strong eddies and whirlpools.
Looking back at the eastern channel, we were glad we
had not followed it, as it was extremely rocky.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill2-108.jpg"><img src="images/ill2-108_th.jpg" alt="A Fine Cataract on the Arinos-Juruena River." title="A Fine Cataract on the Arinos-Juruena River." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">A Fine Cataract on the Arinos-Juruena River.</p>
<hr />
<p>The river was contracting in narrow necks and
expanding into large basins, another of these being
450 m. broad. A strong rapid existed here, owing to
the barrier formed across the stream by a central island
of rock and other boulders. After that came a basin
700 m. wide, with three islands&mdash;Teffe I., Nair I., Rock I.&mdash;in
its western part. The central and eastern passages
were difficult owing to the quantity of rocks which
stood in the way, so we took the canoe down the
channel from S.S.W. to N.N.E., which was also extremely
bad, and where we had to let her down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-109" id="Pg_2-109"></a>[<a href="images/2-109.png">109</a>]</span>
with the greatest care by means of ropes, the baggage
having been previously unloaded. Even then the
canoe got filled with water. That involved a great loss
of time and waste of energy, so that we had to halt
longer than usual in the middle of the day.</p>

<p>Our halting place was most picturesque, situated on
volcanic rocks of great beauty, and overlooking a canal
cut into the rocks, with strong and foaming rapids from
east to west. Strong eddies formed at the end of the
rapids.</p>

<p>After leaving the camp and negotiating the rapids,
we came to an island 150 m. long&mdash;Magda Island&mdash;separated
by a rocky narrow channel from another
island, 50 m. long, west of it.</p>

<p>After the last rapid we were in a basin 800 m.
wide and 1,000 m. long. Strong <i>corrideiras</i> or rapids
occurred all the time, and rocks alone or in groups
standing wherever they were not wanted. Farther on
we came to another big basin, 1,000 m. wide, with a
square island on its western side. The island&mdash;Eva
Island&mdash;was 400 m. broad and of course of an equal
length.</p>

<p>Another island, triangular in shape, 700 m. long&mdash;Rose
Island&mdash;was then observed, after we had gone
over some strong rapids in the passage on the east
side of it.</p>

<p>The river was flowing in a northerly direction, and
shortly afterwards formed two channels&mdash;one north-west,
the other south-west&mdash;which soon joined again.</p>

<p>A beautiful bank of white sand 120 m. long and
4 ft. high stretched along the edge of the water on the
left side of us. Soon afterwards we entered an immense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-110" id="Pg_2-110"></a>[<a href="images/2-110.png">110</a>]</span>
basin, 1,300 m. broad with a large island&mdash;May Island&mdash;on
its western side.</p>

<p>One kilometre farther the island ended at a
place where a lot of rocks stood out of the water. A
little lower down other rocks spread right across the
river in two parallel lines, forming very strong rapids,
which were shot, our canoe coming within an ace of
turning over.</p>

<p>The basin which followed was extremely rocky,
with strong whirlpools, most troublesome to negotiate.
Another island of irregular shape, 200 m. long and
200 m. wide&mdash;Rita Island&mdash;was found in a large basin,
1,000 m. broad, where we came to strong rapids and
violent eddies and whirlpools, the latter most dangerous-looking.
The water revolved with such force
that it formed in the centre of each vortex holes from
one to two feet in diameter.</p>

<p>The channel flowing north on the left side of the
river seemed the better of the two, but it was strewn
with rocks against which we had many collisions, owing
to the strong current, the unmanageable canoe and the
disobedient crew.</p>

<p>Another island 350 m. long&mdash;Eloisa Island&mdash;was to
the north-east of Rita Island. Fifteen hundred metres
farther on another <i>corrideira</i> occurred. A small tributary
entered the Arinos on the right side.</p>

<p>We were then travelling in a N.N.E. direction, the
river being in a straight line for some 3,000 m., in the
course of which we came to a small island on the left
side; then to a great island, 3,000 m. long&mdash;Albert Rex
Island&mdash;with beautiful forest upon it. There were two
other islets in this channel, one a mere cluster of rocks,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-111" id="Pg_2-111"></a>[<a href="images/2-111.png">111</a>]</span>
the other, north-east of the first and 150 m. in diameter&mdash;Belgium
Island&mdash;having pretty vegetation upon it.</p>

<p>A fourth and fifth&mdash;Laeken Island, 300 m. in
length, and Elizabeth R. Island, 5,000 m. in length&mdash;were
separated by a narrow channel. The latter had
most gorgeous vegetation upon it; so tidy was everything
in the thick forest, and the ground under it so
clean that you might have imagined yourself in an
English park.</p>

<p>Those islands were really too beautiful for words.
Not being a poet, I cannot find appropriate language to
describe their wonderful charm.</p>

<p>The river had a tendency to flow toward the west,
and even for 1 kil. in a south-westerly direction. It
had a width of 700 m. A small island 50 m. in diameter,
chiefly formed of accumulated rounded rocks
which had rolled down and deposits of gravel, had
formed in the centre of the stream. Beyond it a charming
little island, 180 m. long&mdash;Germaine Island&mdash;was
found, on which we made our camp. It had an extensive
gravel beach, on which I found beautiful crystals
and pebbles of wonderfully coloured marble.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> left at 8 a.m. on July 20th, the minimum temperature
during the night having been 57&deg; F. We had
hardly gone 1&frac12; kil. when we came to another island,
500 m. long&mdash;Mabel Island&mdash;quite as beautiful as the
one on which we had camped. Small rapids were encountered
where we just managed to avoid dangerous
submerged rocks close to the right bank, near the
entrance of a basin 900 m. wide.</p>

<p>All those basins were really magnificent to look at.
This one, for instance, displayed a lovely island&mdash;Noailles
Island&mdash;500 m. long, and 200 m. wide on its
left side. Picturesque rocks of a vivid red colour
peeped out of the water and broke the current, the
spray that rose in the air forming pretty rainbows.
There was a channel there, 300 m. wide, after passing
the last island. Then came one more great basin
700 m. wide, and yet another pretty island, with a
rocky spur.</p>

<p class="fsc">A Nasty Rapid.</p>
<hr />
<p>We followed a course of 10&deg; b.m. on the left side of
the island&mdash;Margie Island&mdash;which was 500 m. long,
and had a number of subsidiary islands formed by
picturesque groups of rock.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-113" id="Pg_2-113"></a>[<a href="images/2-113.png">113</a>]</span>
We then came to one more great basin, with an
immense quantity of rock in its western part. Many
of the boulders showed a foliation in their strata with
a dip of 45&deg; east. The accumulation of boulders formed
a formidable barrier before we reached an island most
beautiful to gaze upon, so luxuriant was the vegetation
on it.</p>

<p>This particular island was 200 m. long; next to
it was another 150 m. long; then, joined to this
by a link of high rocks to the south-east, was a
third, also of considerable beauty. So charming were
these islands that I called the group the Three Graces
Islands.</p>

<p>The river turned due west from that point in
a channel of continuous rapids and violent eddies for some
3,000 m. We went down, the canoe being knocked
about in a most alarming way on one or two occasions,
and shipping so much water as to reach almost up to
our knees inside it.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that all my photographic plates,
note-books and instruments were in water-tight boxes,
or they certainly would have been damaged beyond
saving. This was not the case with my clothes, shoes,
and bedding, which had now been wet for many days
with no possibility of drying them, as we were travelling
all day long and every day, and during the night
the heavy dew prevented them from getting dry. Why
we did not get rheumatism I do not know, as not only
did we wear wet things all day long, but we slept in
blankets soaked with moisture.</p>

<p>The moment I dreaded most was that in which we
emerged from the rapid into the whirlpool which always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-114" id="Pg_2-114"></a>[<a href="images/2-114.png">114</a>]</span>
followed, and in which the canoe swerved with such
terrific force that it was all we could do to hold on and
not be flung clean out of her&mdash;owing, of course, to the
centrifugal force as she revolved quickly.</p>

<p>Making a survey of the river was getting to be a
complicated and serious job, what with the numberless
islands we encountered, the continuous rapids, and
the constant changes of direction. I was busy writing,
as fast as I could&mdash;only interrupted momentarily by
involuntary shower-baths&mdash;prismatic compass and
watch in hand all the time, the latter in order to
measure the distances as accurately as possible.</p>

<p>We had now come to another group of islands in a
line in the centre of the river. They had been at one
time evidently all one, which had subsequently been
eroded into five separate islands and an extensive
bank of gravel and sand. Taken in succession from
south to north, there was first an oblong island, thickly
wooded, 120 m. long&mdash;Nina Island&mdash;having on its
western side an elongated bank of sand and gravel;
then, where a barrier of rocks stretched transversely
across the stream and where extremely bad rapids
occurred&mdash;three of them in succession, each worse than
the last&mdash;was another island&mdash;Providence Island&mdash;1,400
m. in length.</p>

<p>When we reached any rapid we had to be quick in
judging which was the best channel to follow, as the
current was so strong that we had not sufficient strength
to pull back against it. I generally selected the
channel, my men by this time having gained sufficient
confidence in my judgment, since so far we had had
no serious mishap. But I foresaw that we should soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-115" id="Pg_2-115"></a>[<a href="images/2-115.png">115</a>]</span>
have an accident, as they were getting foolhardy, and
in their ignorance attributed the wonderful luck we
had had entirely to their own skill in navigation.</p>

<p>On that particular occasion we had hardly time to
recover from shooting the first rapid with the velocity
of an arrow, and were wet all over with the splash of
the water, when we came to the second and third rapids,
where the channel was so narrow and rocks were scattered
so near the surface, that it was really a marvel
to me how we got through without capsizing. The
men in their excitement were shrieking wildly as we
dashed through the foaming waters, and there were
also yells of positive terror from the man ahead, who
with a long pole in hand tried to save the canoe from
dashing now upon one rock then upon another.</p>

<p>Below the rapids the three other islands were Dora
Island, 200 m. long; Edna Island, 500 m. long; and
Lucia Island, 700 m. long.</p>

<p>The river was flowing in a westerly and south-westerly
direction, the banks showing a quantity of
rubber trees all along. A tiny islet 50 m. long had
been eroded from the right bank, just above a strong
<i>corrideira</i>, easily identifiable by later travellers who
may visit it, since a huge rock stands there in the
centre of the river.</p>

<p>On the left side of the river foliated rock 10 ft. high
was exposed for the length of 1 kil. Dense forest was
to be seen on both sides of the river all along the rapids.</p>

<p>Two more islands, each 100 m. in diameter&mdash;Romeo
and Juliet Islands&mdash;close to each other, were
then seen on one side of the main channel, which was
200 m. wide.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-116" id="Pg_2-116"></a>[<a href="images/2-116.png">116</a>]</span>
From this point the river actually flowed in a
S.S.W. direction (230&deg; b.m.), and for 2,500 m. we had
to negotiate strong and troublesome rapids with
variations of shallow water, usually with a bottom of
sharp rocks. The water in many of those places, coming
with great force, hit the bottom and was thrown
up again in high waves which swamped our canoe
each time we went through them. In one place we got
stuck on a rock in the middle of the foaming waters,
and had a hard job to get the canoe off again and
prevent her sinking when we had done so.</p>

<p>Where the river turned for another 2 kil. 500 m.
more to the west, another elongated island rose on
the left side of the stream. The island&mdash;Laurita Island&mdash;was
only 80 m. broad, but had a total length of
1,800 m.</p>

<p>More rapids and shallow water above a bottom of
red volcanic d&eacute;bris were found. A small tributary
2 m. wide at the mouth entered the Arinos on the left
bank, not far from the spot where a rocky rugged island
rose in the centre of the stream.</p>

<p>I halted at 11.30 in order to take the usual observations
for latitude and longitude and soundings of the
river. The stream, which was 320 m. broad, below
some rapids, showed a depth of 6 ft. the entire way
across. Farther down, where it contracted to 200 m.
in breadth, it showed a depth of 8 ft. in the centre with
a maximum depth of 10 ft. to the right and left of it,
gradually decreasing to 5 ft., 3 ft., 2 ft., and 1 ft. as it
neared the banks. Lat. 11&deg; 7&#8242;&middot;3 S.; long. 57&deg; 46&#8242; W.</p>

<p class="fsc">A Giant Central Wave emerging from a Narrow Channel.</p>
<hr />
<p>When we resumed our journey after lunch, we
came to another thickly wooded island, 1,000 m. long,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-117" id="Pg_2-117"></a>[<a href="images/2-117.png">117</a>]</span>
350 m. wide&mdash;J. Carlos Rodriguez Island&mdash;with a
cluster of huge rocks on its southern end.</p>

<p>We had a few minutes of comparatively easy
navigation, the river being extraordinarily beautiful in
straight stretches of 3,000 m., 2,000 m., and 3,000 m.,
to 340&deg;, 350&deg;, and 360&deg; (N.) bearings magnetic. In
the first 3,000 m. we came upon another strong rapid
over a barrier of rocks which extended right across
the stream. Beyond the rapids the usual troublesome
whirlpools occurred. A polished dome of rock 10 ft.
high emerged in mid-stream. Then another charming
island&mdash;Nona Island&mdash;with a spit of white sand at its
southern end rose gracefully out of the river. It had
a breadth of 100 m. and a length of 600 m.</p>

<p>More <i>corrideiras</i> and eddies had to be gone over
that day. We seemed to be spending our entire time
trying to avoid&mdash;not always successfully&mdash;collisions
with dangerous rocks. We came to another beautiful
island, 200 m. long and 100 m. wide&mdash;Emma Island&mdash;screened
at its southern end by high-domed volcanic
rocks, and soon after to a rocky island on our right,
separated by a narrow channel from a larger and
thickly wooded island, 300 m. long and 100 m. wide&mdash;Georgia
Island.</p>

<p>The rapids seemed to be getting worse and worse
as we went down the stream. After passing these
three islands we came to a most dangerous spot, the
rapids there being strewn all over with nasty-looking
rocks which did not seem to leave a clear passage
anywhere in a straight line. After 500 m. of anxious
travelling we encountered more rapids and troublesome
eddies. We had by that time got accustomed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-118" id="Pg_2-118"></a>[<a href="images/2-118.png">118</a>]</span>
the danger, and even felt travelling dull and stupid
when we came to a few metres of placid water.</p>

<p>As we were going down a stretch of 3,000 m. to
350&deg; b.m. we found the centre of the river blocked by great
masses of rock; then, a little farther, rocks occupied the
left of the river. We went through a narrow passage
between those high rocks, finding ourselves carried
away helplessly into a rapid of alarming swiftness,
which subsequently shot us into a terrific whirlpool.</p>

<p>Alcides was steering us right into the centre of the
terrifying rotating waters, when I jumped up and,
seizing the steering gear out of his hands, was just
able to avoid disaster. As it was, the canoe switched
off at a tangent with a heavy list to port, leapt out of
the water like a flying fish, and when she dropped
again into the water was carried off at a great speed,
with a heavy list on and filling fast. I do not know
why she did not capsize altogether.</p>

<p>We then had rocks on the left side, rocks on the
right side; a barrier of many rocks across the entire
stream, with a thickly wooded island, 70 m. wide and
200 m. long&mdash;Lilian Island&mdash;on the left side. There
were a great many scattered rocks at the northern end
of the island, where a small rapid was found. Then
we were confronted by 4,000 m. of river in a straight
line. We had gone but 2,000 m. along that stretch
when we came to a lovely rectangular island, with
a spit of rock extending for 120 m. eastward, and
separated by a narrow channel from the island itself.
The island&mdash;Susan Island&mdash;was 100 m. broad and
250 m. long, with its fore-part of gravel as usual. It
was in a basin 500 m. wide.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-119" id="Pg_2-119"></a>[<a href="images/2-119.png">119</a>]</span>
The river turned to the W.S.W., and was there
placid enough, although the current was swift. Where
the river flowed once more in a more northerly direction
we found rocks and two tiny wooded islands on the
left side of the stream, one 20 m., the other 70 m. long.
There a <i>corrideira</i> occurred soon after we had negotiated
a dangerous rapid&mdash;dangerous because of the number
of intricate rocks which forced the canoe to describe
a snake-like dance like a double S, bumping and swerving
with such force from the restless waters underneath,
that it was all we could do to prevent her turning
over.</p>

<p>In a basin 700 m. wide which was further crossed,
we admired a picturesque rocky island of a beautiful
emerald green colour in the centre of the stream. An
immense barrier of rock was on the north-east side of
this basin. Before we halted, absolutely worn out
by the heavy work of the day, we descended another
troublesome rapid&mdash;fortunately that time with no
mishaps of any kind.</p>

<p>At five o'clock we made our camp in the only spot
we could find that was suitable; but no sooner had we
landed than we were fiercely attacked by millions of
<i>sauba</i> or <i>carregadores</i> ants which gave us a lively time
during the entire night. Those ants, which were there
absolutely in millions, were from 1 in. to 1&frac14; in. in length,
and possessed powerful clippers on the head with
which they bit us, giving intense pain. When you
had thousands of them climbing up your legs and over
your body, and dropping upon you from the tree
branches which were alive with them, and clinging to
you with all their might once they had got you with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-120" id="Pg_2-120"></a>[<a href="images/2-120.png">120</a>]</span>
their clippers, you began to think what a fool you had
been to leave your happy home in England.</p>

<p>As I shall have an opportunity of speaking at greater
length of the <i>saubas</i> later in this volume, I shall leave
them now, merely mentioning that during the entire
night we were unable to sleep owing to those brutes.
And that was not all: we had many of our clothes,
shoes, and other articles entirely destroyed by them.</p>

<p>We called that place Camp Carregador. The nights
had become by then quite stifling and damp, the
minimum temperature on July 21st being 63&deg; F.</p>

<p>No sooner had we started on our journey that
day than we came to rapids. A lot of rocks stood
everywhere in the stream. The river after that flowed
in a snake-like fashion for 5,000 m. in a general direction
N.N.E., and was there comparatively free from serious
obstacles. We came to a triangular island 700 m.
long&mdash;Ada Island&mdash;separated from a second island by
a channel 50 m. wide. This second island&mdash;Hugo
Island&mdash;formed an isosceles triangle of 800 m. each
side. These two islands were evidently at one time
joined together, forming a lozenge-shaped island, and
had been eroded in the centre by the back-wash of
the stream at the spot where it formed an angle.</p>

<p>Where the river turned from 315&deg; b.m. to 340&deg; b.m.,
it was much strewn with sharp cutting rocks. We were
thrown with great violence on one of these and very
nearly capsized. Great heaps of volcanic boulders
were now seen on the right side of the channel, and one
island 50 m. long&mdash;Nora Island&mdash;with a few shrubs
on it.</p>

<p class="fsc">Taking the Canoe and Part of the Baggage down a Narrow Passage among Rocks.</p>
<hr />
<p>A great heap of rock was fixed in the centre of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-121" id="Pg_2-121"></a>[<a href="images/2-121.png">121</a>]</span>
stream, forming a kind of spur, beyond which a regular
barrier of rock spread from south-west to north-east
right across the stream. We had difficulty in finding
a suitable passage, but eventually got through close
to the right bank in a small <i>corrideira</i>, easily recognizable
by subsequent travellers, as by the side of it
was a rocky hill of a conical shape 30 ft. high with a
tuft of trees on its summit. On both banks of the
stream rubber trees were plentiful. For 5,000 m. the
river had been proceeding in a perfectly straight line
to the N.N.W.</p>

<p>My work was extremely tiring, as not only was
my time employed surveying the river carefully and
writing up plentiful notes, but also I had to control the
navigation as much as I could and be ready for any
emergency, owing to the capricious nature of my men
and their unbounded disobedience. Orders could not
be given direct, as they were always disobeyed, so that
to obtain what I wished I generally had to give the
contrary order. For instance, if I wanted to avoid a
rock I ordered Alcides to run the canoe on to the
rock; if I wanted to shoot a rapid I ordered them to
take the canoe down with ropes, and so on.</p>

<p>Innumerable rocks were now encountered all the
time. In places regular great tables or platforms of
polished rock were to be seen under the surface in the
clear water. A wonderful group of gigantic rocks was
then reached, with a most charming island peeping
through behind.</p>

<p>We came to an island 450 m. long and 30 m. wide&mdash;Anna
Island&mdash;where two more barriers of rock were
found right across the stream. Beyond, a bank 150 m.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-122" id="Pg_2-122"></a>[<a href="images/2-122.png">122</a>]</span>
long of deliciously white sand was observed, where
some 2 kil. of placid navigation was gone through;
but no sooner had we covered that short distance than
strong eddies were again met with at the point where
the river expanded to a somewhat greater width.</p>

<p>After going almost due west for a short distance
the river gradually swung round to due north, a most
beautiful view opening before us as we got round the
sweeping curve. For 5,000 m. the river now ran in a
perfectly straight line, with its beautiful clear water
flowing over a rocky bed. In the far distance loomed
the first range of mountains we had seen since leaving
the Serra Azul. I had got so tired of gazing at a flat
horizon line that the sight of the range gave me unbounded
pleasure. But I had not much time to gaze
upon the scenery, for rocks of all sizes and shapes were
strewn all along the channel.</p>

<p>Two small islets, each 20 m. long, were passed on
the right bank. Then came more picturesque groups
of rock on the right and on the left of us as we paddled
gaily along, and refreshing accumulations of pure white
sand. Farther on, an island 50 m. wide and 60 m.
long, with a southerly crown of huge boulders&mdash;Corona
Island&mdash;was to be seen close to the right bank.</p>

<p>Some thousand metres before we got to the end
of the long stretch, yet another elongated island 50 m.
long lay close to the left bank. The island was thickly
wooded. From that spot a basin fully 1,000 m. broad
spread out. The easterly portion was a mass of
rock, exposed a few feet above the surface. These
rocks extended right across the basin as far as an
island 350 m. long&mdash;Josephine Island. The vegetation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-123" id="Pg_2-123"></a>[<a href="images/2-123.png">123</a>]</span>
was indescribably beautiful in that part. Immense
quantities of rubber trees stood majestically, so far
unknown and untouched in the luxuriant forest.</p>

<p>Eight distinct groups of rocks were found on the
right-hand side of the river where it flowed for 4,000 m.
in a N.N.W. direction. I took forty-two sights of the
sun that day in order to determine the exact latitude
and longitude. Lat. 10&deg; 48&#8242;&middot;9 S.; long. 58&deg; 0&#8242; W.</p>

<p>When we left again in the afternoon the river, there
350 m. broad, was enchantingly beautiful, absolutely
clear of obstacles as far as we could see. There was a
stretch of 4,000 m. of placid waters, and we imagined
that we had come to the end of our trouble.</p>

<p>Monkeys played gaily among the trees, evidently
taking the greatest interest in the canoe. They followed
us for long distances, jumping from tree to tree,
shrieking with excitement and gazing at us with keen
interest. We in the canoe suffered perfect torture
from the millions of bees, gnats, and mosquitoes, which
settled on us in absolute swarms and stung us for all
they were worth. The lips, eyelids, nose and ears
seemed to be their favourite spots for drawing blood&mdash;perhaps
because the remainder of the face and neck
was already a mass of stings and the skin had got
hardened and parched by the broiling sun. The temperature
was warm&mdash;92&deg; F. in the shade, and 103&deg;
in the sun.</p>

<p>At the end of the 4,000 m. another great mass of
rocks was found extending from south to north right
across the stream. Fortunately we found a channel
sufficiently large for navigating our canoe exactly in
the centre of the river. After turning to the W.N.W.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-124" id="Pg_2-124"></a>[<a href="images/2-124.png">124</a>]</span>
we found a charming little rocky islet with a solitary
tree upon it, and 1 kil. farther a larger island 400 m.
long and 300 m. wide in the shape of a triangle&mdash;Sylvia
Island. This island was separated by a channel 70 m.
wide from an immense island&mdash;Guanabara Island&mdash;6,400
m. long. The channel we followed, the river
there flowing to the S.S.W., was 300 m. wide. Great
masses of rock were visible on the left side. Where
the river flowed in a more westerly direction rocks
formed a barrier right across from south-east to north-west.</p>

<p>Then the river once more flowed in a S.S.W. direction
through a perfectly beautiful channel. A lovely
sand and gravel beach extended from north-east to
south-west at the turn of the river where the great
Guanabara Island ended.</p>

<p>Some 600 m. farther on a huge dome of rock like
a spherical balloon was to be seen, with two smaller
rocks by its side. A basin 400 m. wide was then found
with an islet of sand 100 m. long on the left side, and
a low islet of gravel partly wooded on the right side
of the channel. These preceded another accumulation
of sand and gravel 100 m. long with a few trees upon it,
which was succeeded by a mass of rocks just before
reaching a fair-sized island.</p>

<p>Another great spherical rock was seen before entering
the channel between the island and the left bank.
In the extensive bay great boulders of indescribable
beauty were visible.</p>

<p class="fsc">The Canoe being led down a Rapid.</p>
<hr />
<p>Several <i>capivaras</i> were basking in the sun on the
top of the boulders, and were fired at many times by
my men as they stood up to gaze at us in astonishment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-125" id="Pg_2-125"></a>[<a href="images/2-125.png">125</a>]</span>
before they made up their minds to jump into the water
and escape.</p>

<p>Close to those rocks an island&mdash;Teresa Island&mdash;400
m. long was next admired. Strong rapids had to
be gone through in a great barrier of rocks at the end
of this island. Then no sooner were we thanking our
stars that we had negotiated that portion of our journey
safely than we were among a lot of globular boulders,
some 30 ft. high.</p>

<p>For 800 m. we had a placid time, the water of the
stream being so beautifully green, so transparent, that
we could see the bottom quite clearly. Our happiness
did not last long. We had more rapids and a great
rocky bank spreading from south-east to north-west
right across the stream, and forming in one portion
an island.</p>

<p>We went down another strong rapid between great
and dangerously situated rocks and a large island.
Then came another wonderful group of high domed
rocks, one of the great domes displaying a sharp northern
spur like the ram of a battleship. Next to it were
three cylindrical rocks, just like towers, one of which
leant over the dome.</p>

<p>Yet another rapid was shot through with no misadventure,
and when we came to the end of a large
island 4,500 m. long and 80 m. wide&mdash;Priscilla Island&mdash;preceded
by a smaller islet of sand and gravel, we
arrived at a direct stretch of 4,000 m. of river, flowing
to the west. Another rocky islet with an accumulation
of sand and a lot of scattered rocks by its side, then
a high island, were passed on our right, and farther on
we found another great group of globular rocks at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-126" id="Pg_2-126"></a>[<a href="images/2-126.png">126</a>]</span>
the point where Daphne Island, 350 m. in length,
began.</p>

<p>I hardly had time to map out the numberless rocks
and islands we met before we came upon others. There
again we saw three more islands in succession&mdash;Mars
Island, 500 m. long and 100 m. wide; Jupiter Island,
250 m. long; and a third and smaller one, separated
from the second by a channel strewn with huge boulders.</p>

<p>To the N.N.W., at 340&deg; b.m., we saw a hill 300 ft.
high, some distance from the stream. Innumerable
rocks again occurred in the centre of the channel, and
then we came to an extensive triangular island&mdash;Barretos
Island&mdash;the base of which was 300 m. Its
left side was 2,000 m. long, its eastern or right side
about 1,500 m. A hill range some 300 ft. high was
looming before us to the north-east. The second
island&mdash;Antonio Prado Island&mdash;had a total length of
2,000 m. with an average width of 200 m.</p>

<p>On this magnificent island we halted at five o'clock
in the afternoon, and I took altitude observations with
the hypsometrical apparatus: 1,062 ft. above the sea
level.</p>

<p>We were again lucky in fishing that evening. We
caught six <i>trahiras</i>, several <i>pacus</i>, and two young <i>jahus</i>&mdash;altogether
some 120 lb. in weight. My men had
wasted so much food, and so much had been spoiled by
constant immersions&mdash;many of the tinned meats had
been altogether spoiled by the tins having got rusty
and gradually perforated&mdash;that I was beginning to feel
rather anxious in case our journey should last longer
than I expected. Unfortunately, we had lost most of
our salt, and we had no way of preserving the fish,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-127" id="Pg_2-127"></a>[<a href="images/2-127.png">127</a>]</span>
which we had to leave on the banks, absolutely wasted.
In order, however, to show how lazy my men were, it
is enough to say that, rather than take the slight
trouble of placing some pieces of the excellent fish on
board the canoe instead of trusting entirely to the luck
we might have in fishing the next evening, they had
to go the entire day without food. For some reason
or other we could not get a single fish to bite, and we
did not find a single bird or monkey to shoot.</p>

<p>I was rather interested to observe, in looking over
my notes, that nearly all the rocky barriers we had met
stretching across the river extended from south-east to
north-west. I believe that similar barriers stretched
in the same direction in the other southern tributaries
of the Amazon, the Xingu and the Madeira Rivers, but,
curiously enough, this was not the case with the River
Araguaya.</p>

<p>We had made our camp that particular night on a
lovely beach of white sand, which I found perfectly
delicious, but which my men hated, as there were no
trees on which they could hang their hammocks. They
did not like to go into the luxuriant forest of the
beautiful island, as they were afraid to go too far away
from me, and I did not wish to go too far away from
the canoe, which we had beached on the gravel bank,
in case the river should rise suddenly or something
should happen to make her float away. As I have
said, I never, during the entire journey, let that canoe
go out of my sight for one single moment. The men,
therefore, went into the forest to cut big poles, which
they afterwards planted with much exertion, in the
sand near my camp-bed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-128" id="Pg_2-128"></a>[<a href="images/2-128.png">128</a>]</span>
Some amusing scenes happened during the night,
when the poles gradually gave way with the weight
of the men in the hammocks, and, tumbling down
altogether, gave them severe blows on their heads
and bodies.</p>

<p>The stars were simply magnificent in brilliancy as
I lay on my camp-bed. One particularly, to 290&deg; b.m.
N.W.&mdash;the planet Venus&mdash;was extraordinarily brilliant,
appearing six times as big as any other planet visible
that night. It threw off radiations of wonderful
luminosity, quite strong enough to illuminate with a
whitish light a great circular surface of the sky around it.</p>

<p>In the morning, before we left, Alcides&mdash;who loved
carving names and inscriptions on every tree and stone&mdash;duly
incised the name of Antonio Prado, with which
I baptized the island in honour of the greatest Brazilian
living, upon a giant <i>figueira</i> tree on the southern edge
of the extensive beach of sand and gravel.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> night was heavy and damp. All our things were
soaked in the morning with the dew which had fallen.
We were enveloped in a thick mist when we woke up.
It became a dense fog when the sun rose, and did not
clear up until the sun was fairly high above the horizon.
The minimum temperature during the night had
been 62&deg; F. (July 22nd).</p>

<p>We were unable to leave until eight o'clock, as the
river was dangerous enough when we could see where
we were going, and it would have been rather foolish
to add one more risk to our travelling in the fog.</p>

<p>My men were extremely irritable and morose that
morning, and even our dogs were most troublesome.
We had had a great deal of trouble with the dogs;
they were as disobedient and untrainable as the men.
Nearly every morning we had to waste a considerable
time in getting the animals back into the canoe.
When we were ready to start they generally dashed away
into the forest and the men had to go and fetch them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-130" id="Pg_2-130"></a>[<a href="images/2-130.png">130</a>]</span>
and bring them back. That particular morning one
dog&mdash;the best we had&mdash;escaped, and my men searched
for more than an hour, but were unable to find him.
In trying to run after him they got their feet full of
thorns, and they became so enraged that they decided
to abandon the dog on the island. I called him for
more than half an hour, trying to save his life, but the
animal refused to come. So, much to my sorrow, we
had to pull out without him, and undoubtedly the
poor beast eventually must have died of starvation,
as there was no food whatever to be obtained in the
forest on the island.</p>

<p>The dogs were quite amusing to watch while in the
canoe, their terror when we shot rapids being quite
manifest. They were an additional source of danger
to us, for once or twice while shooting rapids strewn
with rocks they would jump out of the canoe on to the
rocks as we were shaving past them, and we lost much
time on several occasions in order to rescue them. In
going through the forest the poor animals had suffered
much from the attacks of ants and all kinds of insects,
many parasites having got inside their ears and where
the skin was softer under their legs, causing terrible
sores.</p>

<p>They never got fond of anybody, no matter how
well they were treated. In fact, unlike all other dogs
of any other country, they never seemed even to
recognize any of us. Alcides had become the owner of
the abandoned dog in a peculiar way at the beginning
of our journey, when travelling with my caravan of
mules. The dog was going along with a man travelling
in the opposite direction to ours. Alcides, who at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-131" id="Pg_2-131"></a>[<a href="images/2-131.png">131</a>]</span>
time was eating some bread, whistled to the dog, and
from that moment the animal left his master and came
along with us.</p>

<p>Perhaps Brazilian dogs do not give affection because
they never receive any. They were so timid that
when you lifted your hand to caress them they would
dash away yelling, with their tails between their legs,
as if you had been about to strike them. I tried time
after time to make friends with them&mdash;and I am generally
quick at making friends with animals&mdash;but I gave
up in despair the hope of gaining the slightest affection
from those dogs.</p>

<p>When we came to the end of the island we found
another great barrier of foliated rock extending from
east to west, 500 m. across. The basin showed, moreover,
three sets of giant rocks on the left side. In
the north-easterly part where the river narrowed again
there stood a range of hills 300 ft. high, extending from
west to east, and parallel to the rocky barrier across
the basin. A streamlet 3 m. wide coming from the
south-west entered the Arinos from the left bank. The
hill range which stood along the right bank of the river
showed a rocky formation of a greyish colour right up
to its summit, and was, in fact, a mere great rocky
barrier with only a few trees growing in interstices
which had been filled with earth and sand. The
southern aspect of the range was an almost vertical
wall.</p>

<p>The river was proceeding mostly in a westerly and
north-westerly direction for long stretches of 3,500 m.,
4,000 m., 2,000 m., until we came to an equilateral-triangular
island, 300 m. each side&mdash;Erminia Island.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-132" id="Pg_2-132"></a>[<a href="images/2-132.png">132</a>]</span>
A small channel not more than 20 m. across separated
this from an irregularly-shaped island, 600 m. long&mdash;Niobe
Island. After this came a low island of sand
and gravel 5 ft. high and 300 m. long, with merely a
few trees upon it, whereas the other two islands were
covered with dense and most beautiful vegetation.
The main channel of the river was 400 m. wide.</p>

<p><i>Araras</i> (macaws) of great size and of a beautiful
vermilion colour flew overhead, shrieking wildly at
the sight of us. We began to find a great many <i>jacar&eacute;s</i>
(<i>Caiman fissipis</i>) or crocodiles. I saw one sleeping
placidly on an islet of gravel. I landed and photographed
it, subsequently waking it with a start by
throwing a stone at it. My men, who were following
cautiously behind me, opened a fusillade and killed it.</p>

<p>It was really amusing to watch the astonishment of
the few animals and birds we met in that deserted part
of Brazil, as none of them had seen a human being.
They evidently did not know what to make of us.
They generally looked with curiosity and surprise,
and my men could fire shot after shot before they would
attempt to run, or, if they were birds, fly away.</p>

<p>There were in that region some fine specimens of
the <i>cigana</i> (<i>Opisthocomus cristatus</i>) and of the <i>jac&uacute;</i>
(<i>Penelope cristata</i>). The <i>cigana</i> was beautiful to look
at, with brown and yellow stripes, not unlike a pheasant,
and a tuft of bright yellow feathers on the head. All
of a sudden we came upon great numbers of these birds,
and they supplied us with good meals.</p>

<p class="fsc">Terrifying Rapid shot by Author and his Men in their Canoe.</p>
<hr />
<p>There were again plenty of rubber trees in the
forest, plenty of fish in the river. The climate was
not too hot&mdash;merely 87&deg; F. in the shade, 105&deg; in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-133" id="Pg_2-133"></a>[<a href="images/2-133.png">133</a>]</span>
sun&mdash;the insects not too troublesome; so that it
seemed to us a paradise on earth.</p>

<p>We had now before us a great expanse of 5,000 m.
of straight river to 345&deg; b.m., with two parallel ranges
of hills extending from west to east. The second range
was the higher of the two&mdash;some 600 ft., whereas the
first was only 200 ft. high.</p>

<p>What I took to be a great river coming from 75&deg; b.m.
(N.E.), 250 m. wide, joined the Arinos from the right
side; but I was puzzled whether this was not a mere
arm of the Arinos. In the quick survey I was making,
and with the many things which occupied my mind
at every moment, the river being moreover so wide, it
was impossible, single-handed, to survey everything
carefully on every side. Therefore this may have
been a mere arm of the Arinos which I mistook for a
tributary. It was not possible for me to deviate from
my course every moment to go and ascertain problematic
details, but it will be quite easy for subsequent
travellers to clear up this point now that attention
has been drawn to it.</p>

<p>An island, 1,000 m. long&mdash;Olivia Island&mdash;was found
at the point where the main arm of the river flowed
in a direction of 345&deg; b.m., and where to the north-west,
north, and north-east, three hill ranges were before us&mdash;one
300 ft. high, extending from south-west to north-east
on the left side of the river; another thickly
wooded hill from west to east, also 300 ft. high; and
yet another one, the highest of all, behind it from
S.S.W. to N.N.E., on the right bank. The river was
350 m. wide, and its water almost stagnant.</p>

<p>Another barrier of rock held up the stream. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-134" id="Pg_2-134"></a>[<a href="images/2-134.png">134</a>]</span>
came to an island 800 m. long, 300 m. wide&mdash;Sabrina
Island&mdash;on the left side of the stream, which showed
a beautiful spit of white sand at its southern end.</p>

<p>I halted on the bank where the island began in order
to take observations for latitude and longitude, and as
the day was a very clear one I took forty-eight consecutive
sights of the sun with the sextant. Lat. 10&deg; 35&#8242;&middot;1 S.;
long. 58&deg; 12&#8242; W. While I was busy observing the sun
I thought I heard curious noises in the forest just
behind me. The dogs all of a sudden jumped up,
barking furiously, and I heard the sounds of what
seemed an escaping person dashing away through the
thick growth near the stream. My men were greatly
excited, saying it was an Indian who had come quite
close to me, and was about to shoot an arrow while I
was busy with my sextant and chronometers. All
through lunch they sat with their loaded rifles next to
them, in case we might be attacked.</p>

<p>The river now flowed in a straight line for 5,000 m.
in a north-westerly direction. Half-way along was a
large triangular island&mdash;Pandora Island; then farther
on the left another island, 2,000 m. long&mdash;Sibyl Island.</p>

<p>The river was of extraordinary beauty in that
region. The tall range of hills to the north-west of
us showed beautiful cobalt-blue tones against the
whitish and grey sky; while the dark green foliage of
the trees and the yellow blooms of the <i>Oleo pardo</i> trees
visible here and there, the immaculate white sandy
beach along the water line, together with the brilliantly
red and yellow rocks which stood out of the crystalline
emerald water, formed indeed a beautiful scene for
the painter's brush.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-135" id="Pg_2-135"></a>[<a href="images/2-135.png">135</a>]</span>
It did not do to be poetically inclined when
travelling on the Arinos. I had hardly time to realize
how beautiful that scene was when we found ourselves
confronted by another big barrier of rocks, through
which we went over a swift <i>corrideira</i>.</p>

<p>A basin was formed, 900 m. wide, with an extensive
island of rock on the right side of it. Then we suddenly
came to a terrible-looking rapid at an incline so steep
that I foresaw trouble in store for us. There was no
way of stopping anywhere, as the current was swiftly
taking us down.</p>

<p>"We are lost!" shouted one man. "Jesus Maria
Santissima!"</p>

<p>"Paddle away! paddle away, for Heaven's sake!"
I shouted, as I knew that speed alone could save us
from disaster.</p>

<p>Down went the canoe at an angle of 45&deg; in the
foaming and twisting waters of the rapid. Where the
water curled right over itself the heavy canoe was
lifted up in the air like a feather, and as I turned round
to shout to Alcides to steer straight ahead I saw his
expanded eyes looking in terror at the terrific whirlpool
which was facing us at the bottom of the rapid.</p>

<p>"No! no!" cried Alcides.</p>

<p>"Straight&mdash;straight! For God's sake, straight!"
shouted I; and as I saw the canoe swerve to the right I
again shouted to Alcides to steer straight in order to
avoid the dangerous part of the whirlpool.</p>

<p>Alcides would not steer straight, but steered us
instead on the right for the very centre of the whirlpool.
No sooner did the prow of the canoe enter the
circle of the rotating water, which formed a deep con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-136" id="Pg_2-136"></a>[<a href="images/2-136.png">136</a>]</span>cave
hollow 70 or 80 m. in diameter, than, dipping her
nose in the water, she was flung right up into the air,
revolving on herself. Baggage and men all tumbled
over, two men being thrown with terrific force clean
out of the canoe. A lot of baggage disappeared into
the whirlpool. The canoe, although filled with water,
righted herself and spun round helplessly at an alarming
speed. The impact had been so violent that the
men, in tumbling over, had lost all the paddles except
one.</p>

<p>We heard the cries of the two men in the water,
and I saw them struggle in order to keep themselves
afloat. I gave a sigh of relief that the two men&mdash;already
a long distance from us&mdash;were, by a great
stroke of luck, the only two who could swim. I urged
them to have courage and we would come to their
rescue, although for a moment I could not think how
we should do it, as we had only one paddle left and
the steering gear had got torn away from its socket,
although Alcides with great courage had managed to
save it. I ordered my men to paddle with their hands
and with the large oar which was used for steering.
We were tossed about in a terrific manner, the men and
canoe going round and round the whirlpool in an
absolutely helpless fashion.</p>

<p class="fsc">Author's Men shooting a Crocodile.</p>
<hr />
<p>What distressed me more than anything was when I
saw the two men getting nearer and nearer the centre,
although they made a desperate struggle to swim away
from it. In our effort to get to them by using the
steering oar, the canoe, for some reason or other, swung
round upon herself two or three times, and I saw with
gladness the men gradually getting nearer. It was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-137" id="Pg_2-137"></a>[<a href="images/2-137.png">137</a>]</span>
moment of joy when I saw Antonio, who was a powerful
swimmer, within only a few feet of the canoe.
His face was ghastly, with an expression of terror
upon it. He was quite exhausted, and was shouting
pitifully for help. The man X was a few yards farther
off.</p>

<p>The canoe suddenly swung round, going right
against Antonio, who grasped the side of the boat and
proceeded in such haste to climb on board that he
came within an ace of capsizing her. A few moments
later we were alongside of X, but he was so exhausted
that he had not the strength to climb up. We seized
him and with great difficulty lifted him inside the
canoe.</p>

<p>We continued to go round and round the vortex
in a helpless fashion, endeavouring with the steering
oar to get out of that perilous position. As I gazed
around I saw my camp bed and bedding, which were
enclosed in a water-tight canvas bag, still floating close
to the centre of the whirlpool. Alas! a moment later
they were sucked down. Most of our cooking utensils
which were loose in the canoe had been washed overboard.
Two of our casseroles were floating gracefully
in a circle round the whirlpool.</p>

<p>It is curious how people's mentality will work on
such occasions. After we had been some minutes endeavouring
to get away from the centre of the whirlpool,
one of my men, who had recovered from the fright,
saw the cooking pans, which were about to disappear.
His first impulse was to shout that we must go and get
them!</p>

<p>It was with some relief that we were able to extri<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-138" id="Pg_2-138"></a>[<a href="images/2-138.png">138</a>]</span>cate
ourselves, and eventually reached the outer edge
of the whirlpool, where the water changed direction,
and the canoe was swung violently, entering a patch
of comparatively placid water. Paddling with our
hands we slowly reached the bank, and nearly an hour
later&mdash;it having taken us all that time to go about
150 m.&mdash;we baled the water out of the canoe and proceeded
to examine the amount of our loss.</p>

<p>Nearly all the cooking utensils, as I have said, had
disappeared; two boxes of tinned provisions had gone
overboard and were lost for ever; a bag of flour and a
bag of rice had vanished in those terrible waters; a
package containing a great part of my clothes had also
gone for ever, as well as some of the clothing of my
men. What was worse than all for me, my camp-bed
and all my bedding were lost, which would compel me
in the future to sleep either on the ground&mdash;which was
practically impossible in that region owing to the
number of ants and other insects&mdash;or else do as I did,
sleep on four wooden packing-boxes, which I placed in
a line. They made a most uneven and hard bed,
as I had, of course, no mattress and no covering of
any kind. A despatch-box, with some money, a lot
of important official letters and other documents, were
lost, and also my mercurial artificial horizon and one of
my chronometers. A number of other things of less importance
were also gone and quite beyond recovery.</p>

<p>We worked hard all that afternoon and the greater
part of the night in shaping new paddles out of trees
we had cut down with the axes, which were fortunately
not lost. The new paddles were even more primitive
and clumsy than those we had before.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-139" id="Pg_2-139"></a>[<a href="images/2-139.png">139</a>]</span>
We dried what remained of our baggage in the sun
during the afternoon. The beautiful sandy beach on
which we had landed looked very gay with all the
articles I had spread out from some of my trunks, including
a dress-suit which I hung on a young palm,
and other such articles, which looked rather incongruous
in that particular region. All the white linen clothes I
possessed had gone, and there only remained some
good serge clothes which I had kept for my arrival in
civilized places again. My water-tight boxes had been
knocked about so much that they had got injured and
let in a good deal of moisture.</p>

<p>One of my valuable cameras was badly damaged
in the accident, and one of my sextants was soaked to
such an extent that it took me the best part of two
hours to clean it all up again. I saved the negatives
which were in the damaged camera by developing them
at once during the night while they were still wet.</p>

<p>My men were greatly excited over the accident,
especially the two who had fallen into the water. In
a way I was glad it had happened, as I was in hopes it
might be a good lesson to them and they might be a
little more careful in the future. Had Alcides obeyed
my orders we should have gone through safely. I
pointed that out to him, but it was no use; even then
he maintained that in order to be safe you must steer
right into the whirlpool and not out of it&mdash;which really
made me begin to feel rather nervous, as I fully expected,
as we went along, to find worse rapids than
those we had negotiated so far, since we still had to
get down from 1,000 ft. or so to the sea level.</p>

<p>We halted for the remainder of the day. I spent a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-140" id="Pg_2-140"></a>[<a href="images/2-140.png">140</a>]</span>
miserable night sleeping on the packing-boxes, now that
my bed had gone for ever. I did not deserve that bit
of ill-luck, for indeed my camp-bed was the only thing
I possessed which gave me a little comfort. After
working hard all day and the greater part of the night,
a few hours spent lying down flat on the stretched
canvas of the bed were most enjoyable; although never,
throughout the entire journey, was I able to sleep
soundly, as I always had to be on the alert, never
knowing what might happen.</p>

<hr />
<p>The night of July 22nd was fairly cool, the minimum
temperature being 58&deg; F. When we proceeded on our
journey in the morning we passed an island 1,500 m.
long&mdash;Arabella Island. The river was now flowing due
west. Again we came upon rocks in the centre and
upon the right side of the river, with a strong <i>corrideira</i>
and with dangerous submerged rocks close to the
surface. There was an islet 150 m. long on the right
side in a basin 500 m. broad. A hill 100 ft. high stood
on the left side of the stream, while a hill range 300 ft.
high was now visible to the W.N.W.</p>

<p>We had little time to admire the beautiful scenery,
for we soon found ourselves upon another great barrier
with a terrible-looking rapid. I asked my men if they
preferred to shoot it, as the exertion of loading and
unloading the canoe was certainly heavy.</p>

<p>"No, no, no, no!" they all cried in a chorus.</p>

<p>We therefore unloaded the canoe, and with considerable
trouble and waste of time we led her down
the rapid by means of ropes. Even led in that fashion
with the greatest care, the canoe was entirely filled
with water.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-141" id="Pg_2-141"></a>[<a href="images/2-141.png">141</a>]</span>
Islets of rock of considerable beauty rose from the
river on the right-hand side. As we got a little way
farther, slightly more to the north-west, another hill
range, perhaps a little higher than the one we had
already observed, began to disclose itself to the north-west,
on the right side of the river. As we advanced
I further ascertained that the first range extended in
a general direction from south-west to north-east.
The river had actually eroded its way through this
range. Strong rapids were again met with at that
point, the channel being strewn with innumerable
sharp-edged rocks, most unpleasant if you were to
come in contact with them.</p>

<p>A small islet with a picturesque spur of rock on the
north side was here seen; then a larger island, 300 m.
long&mdash;Evelina Island&mdash;also on the left side. The river
flowed for 3,000 m. in a N.N.W. direction, and at the
end of that distance a rectangular island, 200 m. long
and 80 m. wide&mdash;Eileen Island&mdash;embellished it. Like
most of the islands in that particular portion of the
river it had a beautiful spur of rock on its eastern side,
preceded by a little islet also of rock. We passed to
the left of this island. It was separated by a channel
80 m. wide from another narrow island, 200 m. to the
west of it&mdash;Diana Island.</p>

<p>Just before getting to a third range extending from
south-west to north-east, and, like the other two, about
300 ft. high, we came upon a long barrier of rock
spreading diagonally for about 1,000 m. from south-west
to north-east. A long narrow island (200 m. long)&mdash;Bertha
Island&mdash;began from that point close to the
right bank, and another had been separated by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-142" id="Pg_2-142"></a>[<a href="images/2-142.png">142</a>]</span>
water from the bank itself. A tributary 2 m. wide was
observed on the left side. We kept close to the left
bank and passed on our right an island 300 m. long&mdash;Sophia
Island.</p>

<p>So numerous were the islands following one another
that I was beginning to have great difficulty in supplying
sufficient names for them all.</p>

<p>More rapids were reached, and were of terrific force&mdash;especially
in the centre of the river. It took me some
little time to find a suitable passage, but at last I found
a channel 25 m. wide through which I got the canoe
among innumerable rocks. We went over a great <i>filare</i>&mdash;by
which word the Italians cleverly define an extensive
alignment in the stratum&mdash;of rock of extreme hardness
which had evidently been fractured in some violent
commotion of the earth, and had left sharp edges which
cut just like knives close to the surface of the water.
This rocky obstacle extended as usual from south-east
to north-west.</p>

<p>A tiny streamlet entered the river on the left not
far from the hill range on that same side. The trees
in that particular region had a most peculiar appearance:
their high, perfectly straight stems, quite free
from branches or leaves up to their very summit,
looked like so many columns, mostly of a whitish
colour. Many, however, were encircled, others absolutely
smothered with creepers. The scenery was really
beautiful; it was like travelling through fairyland.</p>

<p>In the centre of the basin 400 m. wide to which we
next came was an island, 80 m. in diameter&mdash;Gingillo
Island&mdash;and to the south-west of it a small islet with
an extensive beach and accumulation of rocks in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-143" id="Pg_2-143"></a>[<a href="images/2-143.png">143</a>]</span>
northerly direction. On the southern side of the
river a sand beach, interspersed with rocks, spread
almost across, as far as the latter island.</p>

<p>I took 55 astronomical sights in order to get the
exact latitude and longitude (lat. 10&deg; 30&#8242;&middot;7 S.; long.
58&deg; 19&#8242; W.), and to check the time of the second chronometer,
which still remained in my possession. We
had made poor progress that day as far as the distance
went&mdash;only 17 kil. 100 m.</p>

<p>We had come to some nasty rapids, which at first
looked quite impassable by water, some of the waves
shooting up so high in the air as to make it out of the
question for any canoe to go through.</p>

<p>There was another extensive <i>filare</i> of rock, so
beautifully polished that it looked almost as if it had
been varnished over. It was evidently an ancient flow
of lava, with great holes in it here and there. The
flow spread from south-west to north-east, was of a
brilliant shining yellow, and most beautiful to look at.</p>

<p>I had to make my camp on the rocks near this
rapid, where we unloaded the canoe in order to take
her down by means of ropes by the eastern channel&mdash;very
narrow and very unpleasant, but it was the only
one possible. It was all we could do to hold the canoe
as she tobogganed down the incline, and we had some
nasty falls on the slippery rock trying to hold her.</p>

<p>We had a dangerous bit of work to do the moment
we had descended the rapid, for we had then to navigate
the canoe right across the basin, where whirlpools of
some magnitude were formed, directly over a waterfall
of some height and pouring down great volumes of
water with a terrific roar on the north-east side of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-144" id="Pg_2-144"></a>[<a href="images/2-144.png">144</a>]</span>
basin; then along the really terrifying rapid on the
south-west side. It was necessary to do that, as I had
observed that it was only on the opposite side of the
river that we could possibly take the canoe down, and
no other course was open to us than to go across that
dangerous spot.</p>

<p>We had to be smart about it, or we certainly should
have perished. My men behaved splendidly. We had
reloaded the canoe. The quarter of an hour or so
which it took us to cross that basin was somewhat
exciting, as we struggled through the various whirlpools,
the current all the time dragging us closer and
closer to the waterfall, while my men were paddling
with all their might and Alcides was steering right
against the current in order to prevent the fatal
leap.</p>

<p>I urged the men on, and they paddled and paddled
away, their eyes fixed on the fall which was by that
time only a few metres away from us. They were
exhausted in the frantic effort, and their paddles seemed
to have no effect in propelling the canoe. The men,
who were always talkative, were now silent; only the
man X exclaimed, as we were only eight or ten metres
from the fall: "Good-bye, father and mother! I
shall never see you again!" The other men gave a
ghastly grin.</p>

<hr />
<p>"Go on! Row! row!&mdash;For God's sake row!"
I shouted to them, as I saw they had given themselves
up for lost. "Row!" I shouted once more; and as
if the strength had suddenly come back to them they
made a frantic effort. The canoe went a little faster
for a minute or two&mdash;just enough for us to clear the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-145" id="Pg_2-145"></a>[<a href="images/2-145.png">145</a>]</span>
waterfall and to drift alongside some rocks which stood
in the centre of the stream. We were saved.</p>

<p>My men were so exhausted that we had to rest
there for some time before we could proceed to cross
the dreadful rapid down the other portion of the
barrier.</p>

<p>I was glad we had had that experience, because it
showed me that after all it was possible to make
brave men of men who were absolutely pusillanimous
before. When I mentioned that we still had to go
over the other dangerous part, they said, much to my
delight:</p>

<p>"We are Brazilians&mdash;we are afraid of nothing!
We will come with you." And what is more, they did.</p>

<p>They smoked a few cigarettes. I had always
supplied them with ample tobacco in order to keep
them in a good temper. Then when I gave the order
to start they jumped gaily into the canoe, shouting
again:</p>

<p>"We are Brazilians! We are afraid of nothing!"</p>

<p>So we began negotiating the second portion of
that nasty crossing. There is nothing I admire more
than courage. My men went up in my estimation that
day at least a hundred per cent.</p>

<p>The second part of our crossing was just as dangerous
as the first part&mdash;perhaps more so. The men, however,
behaved splendidly, and rowed with such vigour
that we got through safely and quickly above the most
difficult portion, and eventually landed upon a mass
of rocks on the opposite side of the stream.</p>

<p>There we had a busy time, as we had once more to
unload the canoe, cut a way through the forest in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-146" id="Pg_2-146"></a>[<a href="images/2-146.png">146</a>]</span>
order to convey the baggage overland to a spot about
half a mile farther down stream; then we had to come
back to take the canoe by means of ropes down the
rapid itself.</p>

<p>It was necessary for one of us to be inside the
canoe in order to steer her while being led down.
Alcides, who was indeed an extraordinarily brave man,
would not hand over his job to anybody else, and
insisted on being allowed to steer the canoe. It was
with great reluctance that I allowed him, as he could
not swim. When we proceeded to let the canoe down
by the small western channel, the foaming waters
and high waves rolling back upon themselves with
great force were most troublesome to negotiate. The
canoe was repeatedly lifted right out of the water,
and gave us holding the ropes such violent jerks
that we were flung in all directions. When I got up
again, still holding on to the rope, Alcides had disappeared.
He had been pitched clean out of the canoe.
Fortunately, a moment later I saw that he was clinging
to the steering gear, which we had made extra fast
in order that it might stand the great strain.</p>

<p>We managed to pull the canoe and Alcides close to
the rocks. Eventually we all had to go into the
water up to our necks and lead the canoe by hand with
the greatest care in the swift current for the remaining
distance. Once or twice we were nearly overpowered
by the current, and we were glad when, nearly two
hours later, our job was finished, and, absolutely exhausted,
we made camp for the night on the rocks.</p>

<p>The men were so excited that during the entire
night they sat up commenting on the experience of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-147" id="Pg_2-147"></a>[<a href="images/2-147.png">147</a>]</span>
the day. Their remarks were quite amusing, especially
their imitations of the rush of the water, the bumping
of the canoe, and Alcides' sudden disappearance and
narrow escape from drowning.</p>

<p>The waterfall and rapids spread across the river
at that spot for some 650 m. During the night of
July 24th the thermometer showed a minimum temperature
of 62&deg; F.</p>

<p>I noticed a small streamlet 1 m. wide on the left
bank, and to the W.S.W. a conical hill rising over a
gently sloping undulating range 350 ft. above the river
level&mdash;that is to say, about 1,400 ft. above the sea
level.</p>

<p>A strong wind sprang up, which caught us sideways
and produced such high waves breaking over the
canoe, and so severe a motion, that my men became
ill. We had to stop, until the wind abated, on a
small charming island. As we were approaching the
island Alcides sent us right over a rock which was
sticking some 2 ft. above water. The bottom of the
canoe was so scraped in the violent collision that a
good deal of the stuffing with which we had filled the
longitudinal crack was torn off, and she quickly filled
with water. When we halted more garments had to be
destroyed in order to fill up the aperture to the best of
our ability.</p>

<p>When the storm was over we continued our journey,
going over some rapids in quite a novel way. The
men were quarrelling among themselves and had stopped
paddling, the paddles being waved in the air in a
threatening way as they spoke violently to one another.
Alcides had also left the steering gear, and in his fury<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-148" id="Pg_2-148"></a>[<a href="images/2-148.png">148</a>]</span>
against the other men had seized his rifle in order to
give force to his words. We were approaching the
rapid. I advised them to continue their quarrel after
we had gone through, but they would not listen to me.
The prow of the canoe, just as we were about to enter
the rapid, was caught in a rock, and the canoe swung
right round, so that we shot the rapid floating down
stern first. We shipped a lot of water, the refreshing
bath somewhat cooling the excitement of my men, who,
realizing the danger when we entered the whirlpool,
took to paddling again.</p>

<p>I discovered from their conversation during the
night that my men were imbued with the idea that I
had a guardian angel attending my person, and that no
matter what happened while they were with me they
would have no mishap.</p>

<p>The river gradually turned northwards again. I
noticed on the right side a hill-range 350 ft. high, extending
from south-west to north-east.</p>

<p>The wind came up again, tossing the canoe about
considerably. My men once more became seasick
owing to the rolling. The new paddles we had made
from fresh wood after our accident in the rapids did
not prove much of a success, the wood splitting badly.
We had to keep the various pieces together by tying
them with string. I could not help laughing when I
looked at my men paddling. One paddle had a quadrangular
blade; another formed an elongated oval;
a third had originally been circular but was then
reduced to the shape of a half-moon, the other half
having been washed away.</p>

<hr />
<p>For 4,000 m. the river had flowed due west, then it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-149" id="Pg_2-149"></a>[<a href="images/2-149.png">149</a>]</span>
turned to 310&deg; b.m. Two large islands in succession&mdash;one
400 m. long and 350 m. wide&mdash;Pericles Island; the
second of an equal width to the first, and 700 m. long&mdash;Aspasia
Island&mdash;were seen.</p>

<p>A high wind from the north-east and east continued
the entire day, and broke into occasional severe gusts
that were most troublesome to us. Heavy rain-clouds
hung over our heads. My men felt cold and shivery
and quite miserable in the choppy waters, which made
them extremely ill. Their faces were green and yellow,
their eyes had a pitiful expression in them. They
looked as if they were all being led to execution. The
temperature of the atmosphere was only 75&deg; F.</p>

<p>Shortly before sunset, after a beautiful stretch of
river of 4,000 m. to 335&deg; b.m. (N.N.W.), followed by
one of 4,000 m. 5&deg; farther to the north, we came to an
immense basin&mdash;a regular lake&mdash;4,000 m. long, 1,500 m.
wide, with two lovely islands in its northerly part.
It was there that the great River Juruena, coming
from the south-west, joined the Arinos. We had the
greatest difficulty in crossing the big, deep lake,
because of the high wind which was blowing at the
time. The waves were high and caught us on one
side; the rolling was so heavy that on many occasions
we shipped a great deal of water and nearly capsized.
When we got into the centre of the lake the wind
increased in fury. My men were very ill and much
scared&mdash;for we had a great expanse of water on all
sides and we could not bale the water out of the canoe
fast enough, so quickly was she filling. I urged on the
men all the time and took an extra paddle myself to
encourage them. We made slow progress, the men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-150" id="Pg_2-150"></a>[<a href="images/2-150.png">150</a>]</span>
suffering greatly. I had to wait for their convenience
every few moments when they were badly indisposed.</p>

<p>We tossed about for the best part of two hours,
until at last we reached the opposite side of the lake.
In a hurry to land, Alcides threw the canoe over
some rocks on which the water was breaking with fury.
However, the water was shallow at that point. We
jumped out, and eventually, trembling with cold, we
beached the canoe on a most beautiful island, where
we made our camp for the night.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> spot where the two great rivers met was most
impressive, especially from the island on which we
stood, directly opposite the entrance of the two streams.
The immense lake was spread before us, and beyond
were the two great rivers meeting at an angle. Great
walls of verdant forest lined all the banks and islands
before us. Curiously enough, both in the Arinos and
in the Juruena two long narrow islands appeared
parallel to the banks of each stream. The islands resembled
each other in size. The Juruena had two
islands near its mouth, one narrow and long, the
other in the shape of a quadrangle. The Arinos
also showed a long and narrow island at its mouth,
and another ending in a point.</p>

<p>It was my intention to take soundings right across
the mouth of the Arinos and also across the mouth of
the Juruena, but unluckily, owing to the strong
easterly wind which prevailed that day, it was quite
impossible for me to attempt such a task at the mouth
of the Arinos, and equally impossible was it to proceed
back across the lake to the mouth of the Juruena<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-152" id="Pg_2-152"></a>[<a href="images/2-152.png">152</a>]</span>
to measure the volume of water which came out of
that river. Without any attempt at mathematical
accuracy I should say that the two rivers carried an
almost equal volume of water.</p>

<p>Where we landed there were two separate islands,
one of which I named after my sister&mdash;the Elfrida
Landor Island; the other one, next to it, I named
Francesco Island. The Elfrida Landor Island&mdash;really
most beautiful to look at&mdash;was 800 m. long; Francesco
Island was 1,200 m. in length but not quite so broad.</p>

<p>There was a most picturesque channel 200 m. wide,
with marvellous rocks forming a barrier across it, on
the right side of the river, between Francesco Island
and the right bank. The main part of the stream,
however, flowed in a much larger channel between the
left bank and Elfrida Landor Island.</p>

<p>The joint Arinos-Juruena River had now a total
width of 500 m., and flowed in a direction of 15&deg; bearings
magnetic. I took accurate observations with the
hypsometrical apparatus in order to determine the
exact elevation of that important spot: water boiled
at the junction of the Juruena and Arinos at 210&deg;&middot;4&frac34;,
while the temperature of the air was 70&deg; F.; in other
words the elevation of the place was 987 ft. above the
sea level.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill2-152.jpg"><img src="images/ill2-152_th.jpg" alt="Author's Canoe going down a Cataract." title="Author's Canoe going down a Cataract." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Author's Canoe going down a Cataract.</p>
<hr />
<p>I also took observations there for latitude and
longitude. Lat. 10&deg; 21&#8242;&middot;7 S.; long. 58&deg; 35&#8242; W. The
Juruena entered the lake from bearings magnetic
250&deg; (W.S.W.), the Arinos from bearings magnetic
100&deg; (E.S.E.). The minimum temperature during the
night on Elfrida Island was 57&deg; F. My men suffered
a great deal from the cold, as they had got badly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-153" id="Pg_2-153"></a>[<a href="images/2-153.png">153</a>]</span>
chilled with the wet and the high wind during the day.
Most of them complained of severe rheumatic pains
and violent toothache. They could not understand
why I did not have any pains of any kind&mdash;and to tell
the truth, neither could I, after all we had gone through
of late.</p>

<p>When we left Elfrida Landor Island on July 25th
we had a beautiful stretch of river 4,000 m. long in a
straight line, but with a good many rocks strewn in
the channel. The men paddled unwillingly, as they
said they were aching all over; but the current was
strong and we were going along fairly quickly. My
men said that we must now have come to the end
of all the rapids. I did not care to disillusion them,
although I suspected that we still had hard days
in store. We had not proceeded very far when a
rumbling noise warned us that we were approaching
danger. There was a rapid on the east side of the
river, but it left a fairly easy passage on the west. A
little farther, however, we came to a very bad rapid,
and had to unload the canoe, which we were obliged
to let down carefully with ropes. My men, who felt
feverish and irritable, owing to our previous day's
experience, were greatly upset at this new obstacle
facing us.</p>

<p>The river was 500 m. wide at this part. The rocks
on which we trod when we took the canoe down were
so sharp that they cut our feet. It was not possible
to wear shoes, as when we had them on we slipped
on the rock and had no hold upon the ropes. My men,
in their state of weakness, had not sufficient strength
to hold the canoe, and the moment she entered the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-154" id="Pg_2-154"></a>[<a href="images/2-154.png">154</a>]</span>
swift current she escaped, dragging one man into the
rapid. I jumped into the water after him, and just
managed to grab him before he was swept away altogether
in the terrific current. We were all drenched,
and as the wind blew with great violence that day,
and there was no sun to warm us up, we felt the
cold very much.</p>

<p>The canoe was thrown mercilessly now against one
rock, then against another; but, as luck would have it,
after she had made several pirouettes, we, running all
the time with our bleeding feet on the sharp rocks along
the bank, were eventually able to recapture her at the
end of the rapid. Then came the job of going back
to fetch all the baggage and bring it down, baling the
water out of the canoe, and starting off once more.</p>

<p>My men were tired; they said they could stand the
work no more, and they wanted to remain there and
die. It took much persuasion to make them come on.
I succeeded principally by giving them a good example,
carrying down most of the loads that day myself from
the upper end of the rapid to the lower&mdash;a distance of
several hundred metres. I was getting tired, too, of
carrying the heavy loads, but I never let my men see
it; that would have been fatal.</p>

<p>The river was divided into two channels by a group
of islands which must at one time have been one great
triangular one, subsequently worn by parallel and
transverse channels into seven islands. The first,
most southerly, was 300 m. broad, 150 m. long,
and of a triangular shape. The three immediately
behind this, and of irregular shapes, had an average
length of some 700 m.; whereas the last group of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-155" id="Pg_2-155"></a>[<a href="images/2-155.png">155</a>]</span>
three, all of elongated shapes, had a length of
300 m. each. I was getting to the end of the list of
names for all those islands, and I was at a loss to find
seven names all of a sudden, so I called the group the
Seven Sisters Islands. At the end of the group the
river narrowed to 400 m. in width between a long
island to the west and the right bank, and flowed due
north for 12,000 m. in a direct line&mdash;indeed a most
beautiful sight. Fifteen hundred metres down that
distance a great barrier of columnar or cylindrical rocks
stuck out of the water from W.S.W. to E.N.E. North
of those rocks on the left side, upon the island, not less
than 5,000 m. long&mdash;Lunghissima Island&mdash;was a beautiful
yellow sand beach 200 m. long, which formed a
separate islet with trees upon its northerly half. Numerous
rocks obstructed the east side (right) of the river.</p>

<p>Farther on, another lovely sandy islet 100 m. long
had formed behind a number of rocks, and was of a
clean, beautiful yellowish white, with a few shrubs and
trees growing upon it. All those sand beaches were
extremely interesting to me. I invariably landed
upon them. I had made a wonderful collection of all
the minute plants and delightful miniature flowers
which grew upon these beaches&mdash;an immense variety,
indeed, but of such small dimensions and of such
delicate tints that it required sometimes a great strain
of eyesight to see them at all. Some were really most
beautiful. I spent a good deal of time and patience
in collecting, pressing, and classifying those dainty
little sand-plants, and I was beginning to flatter
myself that I had formed a complete collection.</p>

<p>At the spot where Lunghissima Island came to an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-156" id="Pg_2-156"></a>[<a href="images/2-156.png">156</a>]</span>
end a large triangular island was to be seen on the left
of us. A great barrier of rocks stretched across the
stream, a prominent cluster of picturesque boulders
forming a powerful spur which cut the current at the
southern part of the triangle of land.</p>

<p>Although the thermometer marked 93&deg; in the sun
my men complained of the intense cold, partly because
they all had fever, partly also because the wind was
extremely strong that day and caused waves of some
size in the stream, which dashed against the canoe and
splashed us all over. Again my men were seasick that
day, and got furious with me as I could not help laughing
at their plight.</p>

<p>With a slight deviation of 20&deg; to the west came
another stretch of 4,000 m. in a straight line. A two-humped
range of hills now loomed before us to the
north-west. We had gone along the side of another
elongated island 8,000 metres in length&mdash;Yolanda
Island. When we came to the end of this great island,
two other islands parallel to each other were disclosed
to the west of us, one 1,000 m. long&mdash;Carmela Island&mdash;the
other 600 m.&mdash;Stella Island. The first had a
pretty island 300 m. long&mdash;Hilda Island&mdash;next to it
on the east side. We halted at the end of Yolanda
Island and there took observations for latitude and
longitude, thirty-one consecutive sights of the sun
being taken. Lat. 10&deg; 13&#8242;&middot;3 S; long. 58&deg; 35&#8242; W.</p>

<p class="fsc">The Immense Waves encountered by Author in emerging from the Channel in the Rapid of the Inferno.</p>
<p class="figcenter">(The canoe with its occupants shot up vertically in the air.)</p>
<hr />
<p>When we resumed our journey four more islets were
visible and a barrier of rock from north-west to south-east
again stretching right across the stream. Just
beyond lay Romola Island, 1,200 m. long and equally
broad. At the end of the island we found a channel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-157" id="Pg_2-157"></a>[<a href="images/2-157.png">157</a>]</span>
100 m. wide, separating it from two neighbours on the
east; in fact, much to my dismay, we found ourselves
in a regular maze of islands and rocks, and my time
was fully employed keeping an account of and measuring
them.</p>

<p>A crescent-shaped island&mdash;Urania Island&mdash;1,000 m.
in length, with most wonderful vegetation upon it, was
now on our left. That region was extraordinarily rich
in rubber. The channel which we had followed was
strewn all over with rocks. Another island, 400 m.
long&mdash;Caterina Island&mdash;followed. The current in the
Arinos-Juruena River had a speed of 80 m. a minute.
The river in places where no islands lay had a width
of 200 m. The water was most beautifully clear, of
a lovely emerald green, with a wonderful white sand
bottom clearly visible although the river had considerable
depth in many places. Yet another island, 600 m.
long&mdash;Una Island&mdash;came in sight to the right of us;
then another between two companions, forming almost
a circle round the central isle. The river now formed a
basin not less than 800 m. wide with innumerable rocks
at the entrance. We went on kilometre after kilometre,
spending our time in avoiding unpleasant rocks, when
again we came first to fairly strong rapids, then to an
extremely dangerous rapid, which we shot, as we were
carried away into it before we had time to realize where
we were. We had the greatest difficulty in extricating
ourselves from the many terrifying whirlpools at
the end of the rapid, in a great basin 900 m. wide. We
found a most beautiful halting place on a natural terrace
of volcanic rock some 20 ft. above the river, with
a dome of rock in the centre.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-158" id="Pg_2-158"></a>[<a href="images/2-158.png">158</a>]</span>
I met signs of Indians close to the river. Evidently
a tribe had once halted there, but apparently many
years before our arrival. I discovered their fireplaces,
several carved pieces of wood, and some fragments
of rudimentary pottery in the neighbourhood of this
picturesque spot. In exploring round the place I
also found some almost entirely obliterated indications
of several ancient trails which had been made by the
Indians in the forest.</p>

<p>Looking toward bearings magnetic 340&deg;, and also
in the opposite direction to the south, most gorgeous
river scenes were before us. This was by far the
most beautiful spot I had come across on the river so
far. I therefore named the huge island on which I
stood George Rex Island. I gave Alcides orders to
carve the name on a tree, but as he was an anarchist
he refused to do it, excusing himself by saying that
he had injured his hand.</p>

<p>At that camp we caught over 400 lb. of fish in
less than half an hour&mdash;three <i>jahus</i> among the number,
each weighing over 40 lb. Then we also captured
two <i>cachorra</i> or dog fish, which possessed vicious-looking
molars of great length, not unlike those of a
big dog. Each of these fish weighed over 30 lb.
Then we got eight <i>trahiras</i>, some 20 lb. each in weight.
With the little salt which remained we preserved some
of the fish, as we were now getting very short of food.
However, we had excellent meals most of the time on
the river, frying the fish with fat which we extracted
from the fish itself.</p>

<p>During the night of July 26th we had a minimum
temperature of 55&deg; F., but as we had had plenty to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-159" id="Pg_2-159"></a>[<a href="images/2-159.png">159</a>]</span>
eat the previous evening&mdash;in fact, too much&mdash;we did
not feel the cold quite so severely.</p>

<p><i>Ariranhas</i> in large families were plentiful near that
spot, and came close several times, grinding their
teeth at us, especially when we were slaughtering the
fish on the bank. We kept watch during the entire
night, as on that occasion they were truly vicious. Our
dogs, for a change, became quite sportive. One of
them, named Negrino, got furious with the <i>ariranhas</i>,
and, driven mad by their unmusical noises, actually
jumped into the stream to go to their attack. In a
moment he had quantities of <i>ariranhas</i> upon him, and
was bitten savagely, one ear being nearly torn off. He
endeavoured to beat a retreat, but by that time he
was in mid-stream and struggling for dear life against
his enemies. We put out in the canoe at once and
went to his rescue, eventually getting him on board in
an exhausted condition, and bleeding terribly all over.</p>

<p>We enjoyed a hearty breakfast of boiled and fried
fish before leaving camp at 9 o'clock in the morning.
We were sorry to leave the beautiful camp&mdash;the best
we had had since we had been on the River Arinos.
There were before us two great channels. The one
flowing east was the larger of the two, fully 400 m.
wide and 3,000 m. long in a straight line. As we were
paddling along we passed on our left a triangular island
the southern side of which was 2,000 m. long, the south-east
side 500 m.&mdash;Angela Island.</p>

<p>Where the river deviated to 30&deg; b.m. a perfectly
straight stretch of 8,000 m. was before us&mdash;a
most beautiful sight. Two parallel islands, only
50 m. wide, one 400 m. the other 300 m. long, were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-160" id="Pg_2-160"></a>[<a href="images/2-160.png">160</a>]</span>
on the right of us, in the part of the river where
George Rex Island, which was still to the right of
us, described a graceful semicircle. Fifteen hundred
metres farther down George Rex Island came to an
end with a beautiful spit of sand 200 m. long. Just
beyond, still on our right, another island, 400 m. long&mdash;Rosalinda
Island&mdash;was passed, also with a lovely spit
of sand 200 m. in extent. The river at this place had
a total width of 500 m. At a point 5,000 m. down the
straight stretch due east we came to three parallel
elongated islands, two of them 300 m. long, the third
1,000 m. in length, all three on the right of us as we
floated down. A barrier of rocks extended right across
the stream from north-west to south-east, at a spot
where on our left side, at b.m. 330&deg;, a hill range extended
northwards. With a slight deviation of 10&deg; eastward
(40&deg; b.m.) another beautiful stretch of 6,000 m. was
before us. More islands, more clusters of picturesque
rocks were passed. First came a group of two islands,
the larger 350 m. long&mdash;Vanessa Island; then a beautiful
clean sand-spit 150 m. long, almost in mid-stream,
preceded a group of three parallel islands&mdash;Philomela
Island, 400 m. long, Portia Island, 300 m. and Psyche
Island, 4,500 m. Beyond these were two more islands,
one triangular in shape in the centre of the stream&mdash;Rhea
Island&mdash;some 250 m. long, with a strong
<i>corrideira</i> at its north-easterly terminus.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill2-160.jpg"><img src="images/ill2-160_th.jpg" alt="A Giant Sucur&iacute; Snake with Entire Deer contained in its Digestive Organs." title="A Giant Sucur&iacute; Snake with Entire Deer contained in its Digestive Organs." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">A Giant Sucur&iacute; Snake with Entire Deer contained in its Digestive Organs.</p>
<hr />
<p>A most gorgeous sand-bank of great length now
lay on our left, while on the right we had two small
islets, one 100 m. long, another, beyond it, 500 m. long.
A tributary entered the Arinos-Juruena at that spot
on the right side. Where the river turned again due<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-161" id="Pg_2-161"></a>[<a href="images/2-161.png">161</a>]</span>
east for 3,000 m., another set of parallel islands with
a chain of hills beyond them on the right bank was
to be seen. The hill range extended from north-west
to south-east. All these ranges, with a backbone
of rock underneath, formed, as it were, the
ribs which held up the central plateau of Brazil.
We were now in a region of wonderful accumulations
of sand; nearly all the islands showed a sand-spit of
great length on the up-stream side. Great islands
occurred once more: Paulina Island, 2,500 m. long, on
our left; another, 200 m. long&mdash;Olivia Island&mdash;on our
right; and a third&mdash;Clara Island&mdash;just beyond it. A
long tail of rocks followed, and the channel was strewn
with dangerous rocks where the river had cut its way
through the range of hills.</p>

<p>What must have been formerly an immense island
which had become cut up into three was now on the
left of us as we followed the central channel in an
easterly direction. The first of these was comparatively
small; the next&mdash;Tristan Island&mdash;was 1,500 m.
long; the third&mdash;Isolda Island&mdash;1,000 m. long. All
were of extraordinary beauty. Rubber trees were to be
seen, but not in such great numbers as we had found
farther up the stream. Evidently the soil was somewhat
too rocky and not sufficiently moist for their
healthy growth.</p>

<p>From due east the river suddenly turned to due
north, diverted by the great rib of rock which had
formerly made part of the hill range we had now on
our right. We had a good deal of trouble here, as
difficult rapids were encountered, and sharp, cutting
rocks, collision with which would have been fatal for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-162" id="Pg_2-162"></a>[<a href="images/2-162.png">162</a>]</span>
us. Our canoe, after the many bumps we had already
experienced, gave alarming signs that she might split
in two longitudinally at any moment. For 5,000 m.
the river flowed in a northerly direction. Great
domes of granite and immense boulders were scattered
near the left bank, and rocks of all sizes and shapes
emerged from the water all over the basin, which was
600 m. across. Another barrier of rock stretched
from north-east to south-east and formed a high drop
in the river. We had to unload the canoe once more
upon some rocks in mid-stream, then let her gently
down the step of foaming waters by ropes. We were
then in a magnificent basin 1,000 m. wide, with a great
cluster of impressive rocks on the right side, in front of
two enchantingly beautiful islands&mdash;Melisande Island,
400 m. long, Pelleas Island, 700 m. long&mdash;on the left.</p>

<p>Whenever I was gazing enraptured at the heavenly
scenery Alcides always managed to send the canoe on
to some rock, which quickly brought me back, not to
earth but to water. His principle in life was always
to do the worst thing and then you knew that nothing
worse could happen&mdash;a topsy-turvy philosophy for
which we all had to suffer. Emerging from the basin,
we had two channels before us, one to the N.N.E., the
other N.N.W. Gigantic palm trees such as we had
seen along the River Arinos were now to be seen all
along the banks of the river. We saw in the water
not far from us a large <i>sucuri&uacute;</i> snake (<i>Eunictes murinus</i>),
fully 6 in. in diameter. It peeped its head out of
the water to gaze curiously into our canoe, and caused
some excitement among my men.</p>

<p>Another immense barrier of rocks with most trouble<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-163" id="Pg_2-163"></a>[<a href="images/2-163.png">163</a>]</span>some
rapids extended from south-west to north-east
right across the stream. That seemed a great place for
snakes, especially in the narrow and tortuous channel
which we followed, between a great island&mdash;Victor
Emmanuel Island&mdash;and the left bank. We were going
along fairly gaily when I saw a huge snake&mdash;another
<i>sucuri&uacute;</i>&mdash;floating upon the water among the foliage and
branches of a fallen tree. The section of the body
which I could perceive measured fully 2&frac12; ft. in diameter,
and I must say that for one moment&mdash;we were
only about 20 ft. away from it&mdash;I was somewhat
surprised, as my quickly calculating mind constructed
in my imagination a snake at least 100 ft. long. My
men immediately took to their rifles, and were about
to open a fusillade, but I stopped them, not caring to
disturb the sleep of so gigantic a reptile. It was with
some relief that, as the canoe floated quietly a little
farther, I perceived the head of the snake resting
gracefully in a sound slumber upon a branch of the
tree out of the water. The head was of more normal
proportions. We landed a little distance away as
quietly as possible, my men trembling all over with
excitement and fear in case the reptile should wake
up. Then all together they opened a fusillade until a
bullet actually struck the snake and it wriggled about.
There was a stampede of all my men through the
foliage and plants which grew along the stream. The
snake was dead. When they had made quite sure that
life was extinct my men returned and pulled the snake
out of the water. Although the section we had seen
floating was so big, the rest of the body was not more
than 4 in. in diameter. The snake had eaten an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-164" id="Pg_2-164"></a>[<a href="images/2-164.png">164</a>]</span>
entire <i>veado</i> (deer), and that was the cause of the great
swelling of the central part of its body. The shape of
the devoured animal could be seen plainly inside it.
The photograph of the reptile which I took is given
in one of the illustrations of this book. The light was
not good for photographic purposes, as it was late in
the afternoon and the snake, which after all was only
18 ft. 5 in. long, lay under the shadow of the foliage,
which made photography rather difficult. As I was
trying to get a second photograph my men proceeded
with their knives to open the snake and see what was
inside. The terrific odour which ensued when they
did so made us violently ill, causing desperate vomiting.
I have seen it stated, in some books which have been
published about South America, that snakes of incredible
length are believed to exist on that continent.
Undoubtedly the notion has been suggested by the fact
that inexperienced travellers have seen immensely
broad traces of snakes along the soft ground near rivers.
Measuring the diameter of those trails they came to
the conclusion that the snake was 80 to 100 ft. long,
and without taking further trouble to ascertain they
stated they had actually seen a snake of that length.
Whereas, as a matter of fact, as in the case I have
described, the immense diameter of the snake was
merely in the section which enclosed some big animal
which had been swallowed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> camped some hundred metres away from the spot
where we had killed the <i>sucuri&uacute;</i>. It was getting late.
My men did not sleep a wink the whole night, as they
thought perhaps the mate of the snake might come
and pay us a visit. We had a lively time the entire
night, as we had made our camp over the home of a
family of <i>ariranhas</i>. They had their young in a small
grotto in the bank, and we heard them all night squealing
for their mothers, who were grinding their teeth
and shrieking furiously a little way off from the bank,
not daring to enter their homes while we were near.
They were, I think, more frightened of the fire which
my men had made than they were of us. There were
twenty or thirty of them, and they made so much
noise during the night that it was quite out of the
question to rest. The vegetation was very thick,
the damp considerable, and the air quite stifling, with
a minimum temperature of 60&deg; F. Occasionally, when
the air moved at all, we could smell our friend the
dissected <i>sucuri&uacute;</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-166" id="Pg_2-166"></a>[<a href="images/2-166.png">166</a>]</span>
We were glad to leave at eight o'clock the next
morning; we seldom could make an earlier start, owing
to the slowness of my men in getting their breakfast
and mine ready, and reloading the canoe, as all the
baggage was taken out every night. Where we had
made camp, Victor Emmanuel Island came to an
end, the length of the island being some 14 kil. We
had great fun just before leaving, the <i>ariranhas</i> coming
boldly to attack us as we were getting into the canoe.
Our dogs, which had been squealing and growling the
whole night at the unmusical shrieks of the <i>ariranhas</i>,
now jumped into the water, and there was a fierce
fight between them and the amphibious animals. My
men, as usual, fired a great many shots. Eventually
we recovered our dogs and started off once more on
our journey.</p>

<p>The river flowed from that point at first mostly in
a north-easterly direction and in a somewhat winding
course; then gradually tended toward the north-west.
In the western part of a large basin 1,200 m. broad
were two islands and innumerable rocks. Then,
farther on, one more long rocky barrier extended from
north-west to south-east in the north-western part of
the basin. Once more did we have to let the canoe
down the terrific rapids by means of ropes.</p>

<p>Where the river turned to the north-west it was
500 m. wide and most beautiful. A great many islands
were seen, and innumerable rocks barred the entrance
of the channel at the end of the basin above described.
Soon after, however, we entered another basin
1,000 m. wide, with more islands and rapids fairly easy
to negotiate. Once more did the river turn due north<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-167" id="Pg_2-167"></a>[<a href="images/2-167.png">167</a>]</span>
for 6,000 m., after we had gone over another swift and
most troublesome rapid, where we had to unload our
baggage and take the canoe down carefully with ropes.
After that we entered a long channel strewn with rocks.
We had not gone far when another strong rapid was encountered,
over another great barrier of rock. No sooner
had we negotiated that difficult passage than another
great barrier of rock, also from south-west to north-east,
had to be gone over through a troublesome rapid.</p>

<p>My men were getting tired of exploring, and
were perplexed, because the more dangers we surmounted
the greater seemed the dangers confronting
us. They were beginning to lose the nerve they had
temporarily acquired, and were now so scared at the
vicious waters that they tried to keep the canoe all
the time close to the banks or islands, the river being
so deep that they thought this was the best way of
saving their lives in case we had a bad accident. The
current was extraordinarily swift, and to make things
worse a strong north-easterly wind blew with great
fury, driving us back and producing such high waves
that our canoe was constantly filled with water. The
result of keeping so close to the bank, and having our
heads continually brushed by the foliage which overhung
the stream, was that each time we came in contact
with the branch of a tree thousands of ants would
drop on to the canoe and upon us, and would bite us
furiously. This was most trying&mdash;an additional torture
to that we had to endure of being stung all over
by other insects which followed the canoe in swarms.</p>

<p>We had not gone much farther along when within
1,000 m. we came to three nasty rapids in succession,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-168" id="Pg_2-168"></a>[<a href="images/2-168.png">168</a>]</span>
over barriers of great rocks intersected by interesting
veins of quartz. From that point the river was fairly
straight for 7 kil. We had that morning encountered
five troublesome rapids, which had given us endless
work. When we halted we were simply ravenous.
We were fortunate enough to get plenty of fish for
lunch, and while my men were enjoying a hearty feast
I took the usual astronomical observations, eaten all
over as I was by mosquitoes and <i>piums</i>, while bees
innumerable had settled on my face and arms. The
latitude was 9&deg; 40&#8242;&middot;4 S.; the longitude 58&deg; 34&#8242; W. The
bees had a most peculiar pungent odour, which they
seemed to leave on one's skin when they had walked on
it. We kept our heads wrapped up in towels; but even
then we suffered a great deal.</p>

<p>When we started in the afternoon we continued to
travel in a direction of 330&deg; b.m., and came to a large
basin, easily identifiable by subsequent travellers by
three extensive domes of granite on the right side,
two of them actually on the bank of the stream at the
entrance of the basin. Where an elongated island,
3,000 m. long&mdash;Oriana Island&mdash;beside which we had
travelled, ended on our left, we saw another island that
continued half-way down the basin, here some 2,000 m.
wide. The second island&mdash;Diana Island&mdash;was fully
8,000 m. in length. In the centre of this great basin
was a triangular island&mdash;Pomona Island&mdash;4,000 m. long
and with a base of 1,500 m. A tributary was visible
on the right bank, just opposite a great dome of granite
with an appendix of sand and gravel which stood in
the middle of the channel. After we had travelled for
2,500 m., a basin some 1,400 m. wide opened again,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-169" id="Pg_2-169"></a>[<a href="images/2-169.png">169</a>]</span>
with a small island, 400 m. long, in the centre&mdash;M.
Adams Island. This charming islet had a picturesque
headland of rock on the south side, and a long spur,
also of rock, to the north. We made our camp here.
The river was really marvellously beautiful at this
point, the vegetation all round being vigorous and
healthy, with a great wealth of rubber trees, while the
huge volcanic rocks strewn about added much to the
picturesqueness of the scene.</p>

<p>It was warm during the night (minimum temperature
63&deg; F.), and we were treated to a most tormenting
concert of mosquitoes. They swarmed positively in
millions around us. With my bed and bedding which
I had lost in the rapids I had unfortunately also lost
my mosquito net, and I now was suffering greatly
from the stings of all the troublesome insects. My
bones were aching all over from sleeping on the uneven
packing-cases placed in a row which now formed my
bed. It took too much time and trouble to unfasten
the straps and buckles which kept the boxes tightly
closed, and they did not add to the comfort when one
lay spread on them.</p>

<p>When we left in the morning of July 28th, going
along a beautiful stretch of close upon 25 kil. in great
expanses from 4,000 to 6,000 m. long, we passed first
of all an elongated quadrangular island 1,500 m. long;
then farther on great masses of volcanic rock. At
the end of that stretch the river divided into two
channels separated by an equilateral-triangular island,
the side of which was 2,000 m.&mdash;Minerva Island. Another
island, also of great beauty, and with a considerable
number of rubber trees upon it, was found a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-170" id="Pg_2-170"></a>[<a href="images/2-170.png">170</a>]</span>
little farther, and there a bar of sand spread beneath
shallow water right across the stream.</p>

<p>We had gone 31,500 m. that morning. When we
found a most beautiful beach of lovely sand we could
not resist the temptation of halting on it to prepare
our lunch. Our surprise was great when we set foot
on the beach to hear shrill whistles beneath us. The
beach was formed of whistling&mdash;or singing&mdash;sand. The
reason the sand was musical was because some large
insects had bored thousands of holes of great depth into
its moistened mass, which allowed the holes to retain
their form. When the sand was trodden the pressure
drove the warmish air contained in those holes with
great force through the contracted apertures and caused
a sharp whistling and occasionally quite melodious
notes.</p>

<p>I again took observations for latitude and longitude
at this place, but I was beginning to find the
work too heavy&mdash;not the observing in itself, but the
computing of all the observations, at which I was not
particularly quick. (Lat. 9&deg; 24&#8242; S.; Long. 58&deg; 40&#8242; W.)
Also, the great care which I had to take of the chronometer
under most difficult circumstances was a trial to
me, considering the numberless things I had to look
after. The only little comfort I had on that journey
had been my camp bed, on which I could, if not sleep
soundly, at least rest my weary bones for a few hours
at night. That had now gone, and I was beginning
to feel the strain of the hard work, constant mental
exertion, and the total lack of rest.</p>

<p>We had passed a great number of islands in the
morning: one 2,000 m. long&mdash;Melusine Island; another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-171" id="Pg_2-171"></a>[<a href="images/2-171.png">171</a>]</span>
300 m.&mdash;Janus Island; a third 3,000 m.&mdash;Midas Island&mdash;by
the side of which was another enormous island,
some 6,000 m. in length&mdash;Miranda Island. Then little
islets 200 and 250 m. long, and another big island,
2,000 m. from end to end&mdash;A. Mas&otilde; Island.</p>

<p>Most beautiful sandy beaches were now constantly
seen, mostly, like the one on which we had landed,
composed of singing sand. (Some of those beaches
were 200 and 300 m. long.) The beach on which we
had landed for lunch was at the southern end of a
great island, 5,700 m. long, which I named Queen Mary
Island.</p>

<p>We left again that afternoon, travelling fairly
speedily, chiefly in W.N.W. and S.S.W. directions, varying
from 290&deg; b.m. to 230&deg; b.m. When we came to the
end of Queen Mary Island, after passing some really
remarkable beaches on which we found a great many
turtles' eggs, we came to a large basin, 1,800 m. across,
with numberless rocks scattered on the north and south
sides of it. The river there flowed due west; in fact,
those rocks formed a kind of corona all around the
great circle. A crescent-shaped island, 2,800 m. long&mdash;Giselle
Island&mdash;was next passed. The channel
through which we went was full of dangerous rocks, and
had a width of 280 m.</p>

<p>Soon after another basin 1,600 m. broad was reached,
with a formidable barrier of islets and rocks spreading
from south to north. The river there flowed in a perfectly
straight course for 10 kil. to 310&deg; b.m. A most
extraordinary-looking islet with a circular terrace of
rock on the east side of it, which was passed in mid-stream,
was surrounded by a giant crown of pyramidal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-172" id="Pg_2-172"></a>[<a href="images/2-172.png">172</a>]</span>
rocks of great height emerging in sharp points from
the water. We had gone but 6,000 m. of that distance
when we came to an island on the right side with a
gorgeous spit, also of musical sand, 300 m. long. The
island itself was only 700 m. long including the sand-spit&mdash;Kuvera
Island. We were then in an immense
basin with leaden waters as still as those of a pond.</p>

<p>We made our camp in a most picturesque spot, an
immense beach forming innumerable indentations, really
like small dunes of sand deposited by water. The
accurate elevation of that place was, according to the
observations taken with the hypsometrical apparatus,
967 feet, water boiling at that spot at 210&deg; 3&frac34;, and
the temperature of the atmosphere being 72&frac12;&deg; F. The
indented beach, not unlike a giant double-comb, was
at the beginning of a great island which I named James
Dewar Island, in honour of the great discoverer of
liquid air. The minimum temperature during the
night of July 29th was 55&deg; F.</p>

<p>Since we had come to the enormous sand accumulations
along the stream the troublesome insects which
worried us day and night seemed to have doubled or
trebled in numbers, and we suffered positive torture
from them, especially when we landed anywhere.</p>

<p class="fsc">Treble Vortex.</p>
<p class="figcenter">(The water revolved in three different directions in succession.)</p>
<hr />
<p>We left fairly early in the morning, finding soon
afterwards a group of sharply pointed rocks, some
above the surface of the stream, some&mdash;most dangerous&mdash;just
under the surface. Another basin, 1,000 m.
broad, was crossed, which contained two islets and a
number of rocks forming a barrier from south-west to
north-east. Two kilometres farther along another immense
barrier of rocks and numberless islets obstructed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-173" id="Pg_2-173"></a>[<a href="images/2-173.png">173</a>]</span>
the river from south-west to north-east, so that for a
little time we could not see which way the stream
flowed out of it at all. Sharply-pointed rocks, ugly
and fearsome-looking, stood up everywhere. When
eventually we did perceive a channel, down which we
went, we found terrifying rapids followed by fearful
eddies and a most alarming whirlpool.</p>

<p>I could not measure the exact width of the basin
there, as there was a regular maze of islands and I
could not well see from the canoe where the banks
exactly were.</p>

<p>A great island, 2,000 m. long&mdash;Normand Island&mdash;presently
divided the river into two great channels, the
north-easterly one of which we followed, finding more
fearsome rapids and strong eddies, which knocked the
canoe and us about in a dangerous manner.</p>

<p>I was greatly concerned in going down all those
rapids, as the canoe was now in a pitiable condition.
We had no way of repairing her, and I was afraid that,
with the strain of the terrific current, if we had banged
too hard against a rock, she might have split in two.
I was not so anxious for myself as I was for my men,
who would certainly have been drowned, as four of
them could not swim. Also, after all the trouble I had
taken to make valuable botanical collections and a
unique collection of photographs, I was most anxious
to bring them all back safely. I was particularly
anxious to bring back to Europe the wonderful fossils
I had collected on the Plateau of Matto Grosso, which
I had long ago packed in one of the cases that were
fortunately among the things saved from the previous
disasters. My men had invariably grumbled at having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-174" id="Pg_2-174"></a>[<a href="images/2-174.png">174</a>]</span>
to carry that particular heavy box, when we had to
unload the canoe and take the baggage on our heads or
shoulders at the many rapids we had encountered.
They had never once missed an occasion to remonstrate
and swear at the absurdity of having to sweat to carry
"those blessed stones," or "the devil's own stones,"
as they called them.</p>

<p>We had gone but a few thousand metres when we
once more came to another great barrier, with two
islands, stretching, like most of the others, from south-west
to north-east. The only point at which we could
take the canoe down was in the rapid in the very centre
of the stream&mdash;a nasty-looking place, I can assure you&mdash;followed
by a whirlpool of such proportions as would
have frightened most humans. I must say for my
men that they showed a great deal of courage that day.
Whether it was because they did not quite realize the
danger, or whether it was because they had got accustomed
to it by then, I do not know; but the fact remains
that when I ordered them to go down that
terrifying place they obeyed without saying a word.</p>

<p>We had to exercise the greatest care, having to
jump out on small rocks which stuck up in the middle
of the rapid in order to arrest the almost uncontrollable
speed of the canoe. Had they missed their footing while
jumping on those rocks and holding the ropes attached
to the canoe, the men would certainly have lost their
lives, as it was out of the question to save anybody in
those diabolical waters. Therefore, when you considered
the terrific speed at which the canoe was travelling,
and that the men must have known that a mistake
in judging the distance would have meant utter de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-175" id="Pg_2-175"></a>[<a href="images/2-175.png">175</a>]</span>struction,
you could not but admire them for their really
amazing self-confidence. On many occasions, indeed, I
had to do the same thing myself, but I must say I never
liked it much; although I was in a better position
than they were, as I am a good swimmer&mdash;not that a
swimmer would have much chance in those waters.</p>

<p>A number of islets were seen below the rapids and
whirlpool. From that point we discerned on the right
bank an elongated hill, 100 ft. high. Slightly beyond,
preceded by a great mass of rock, was another island
200 m. long, dividing the stream in two. Two other
islands, one 700 m. long&mdash;Leda Island&mdash;the other one
Medea Island, of greater length but much narrower,
were disclosed behind it.</p>

<p>Then came another great barrier of rocks extending
from south-west to north-east, and more rapids to
be negotiated. A series of elongated islets and sand-banks
occurred in the basin which followed, 1,300 m.
wide. Beautiful sand-beaches had formed on either
side of that lovely bay. The river then narrowed again
to a width of 500 m., and we saw a long flat island of
sand, 200 m. long and 50 m. wide, enclosed by rocks
in the centre of the stream.</p>

<p>We continued our journey, after the usual halt for
taking astronomical observations, and had before us a
small hill 100 ft. high at bearings magnetic 300&deg;.</p>

<p>We came to a series of most dangerous rapids with
terrific whirlpools, especially after the first and second
rapid. Another great barrier of rocks with huge
boulders spread across the stream from south-west to
north-east. An isolated hill was to be seen on the
left bank where this barrier was found. A strange<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-176" id="Pg_2-176"></a>[<a href="images/2-176.png">176</a>]</span>
coffin-shaped boulder of immense size was then reached
on the right side of the stream, just after we had passed
a delightful sand-spit 100 m. long enclosed within a
stockade of pillar-like rocks.</p>

<p>From this point we had 4,000 m. of clear navigation
to 280&deg; b.m. It seemed heavenly to us to
be in smooth waters again, and my men flattered
themselves that we had now come to the end of the
rapids altogether. But we soon arrived at innumerable
rocks in a confused mass right across the stream, between
which the river flowed with great force in a
contracted neck. We passed between two islands,
each 200 m. long, at the end of which was a rapid.
An island 1,000 m. long was there formed&mdash;Bomfin
Island. Dangerous rapids occurred half-way down its
length on the right; then followed a mass of square
columnar pillars of rock not unlike basalt. That was
all very beautiful to look at, but we had endless trouble
in extricating our canoe from among the numberless
impedimenta which obstructed navigation.</p>

<p class="fsc">At the August Falls.</p>
<hr />
<p>Another most beautiful island, 520 m. long&mdash;Jessica
Island&mdash;was passed just before getting to really formidable
rapids, down which we had the greatest difficulty
in letting the canoe, even by the judicious use of ropes.
The navigable channel of the river&mdash;if navigable it
could be called&mdash;swerved from north-west to due north.
In a basin of immense size were a number of islands
from 300 to 200 m. in length, and enormous boulders
with cataracts of great height between. The roar made
by the water falling over was so great that it resembled
thunder. The difference of height between the top
and the bottom of the rapid was not less than 10 ft.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-177" id="Pg_2-177"></a>[<a href="images/2-177.png">177</a>]</span>
The water in the channel we followed went over a
great slope of lava above which numerous boulders
had accumulated.</p>

<p>My men became perplexed when they saw the formidable
rush of water, but before we had time to do
anything we were swept away at such a speed that for
one moment I really believed we were lost. My men
laughed hysterically, and in that laugh I joined when
we came out at the other end still alive. We had
shaved several rocks so closely that great patches of
the stopping in the side of the canoe had been torn off
altogether, and we were filling fast with water.</p>

<p>Our merriment did not last long, for in a few
moments we had drifted on to another and worse rapid,
much more terrific than the one we had just gone
over. We just managed to hold the canoe on the
upper edge of the foaming stream, trying to get the
ropes ready in order to let her down. We were in mid
stream, not less than 200 m. away from the right bank.
We unloaded a portion of the baggage on the rocks and
proceeded to let the canoe down with ropes&mdash;a most
dangerous job in that particular rapid, because at the
end of the rush of water stood up many rocks, which
drove the water back again and eventually switched
it off, curling over itself at a very sharp angle on one
side and on the other. A diabolic-looking whirlpool of
great depth formed on the other side of those rocks.</p>

<p>I fully realized that the strength of us seven men
was hardly sufficient to hold the canoe, particularly as
all of us were immersed waist-deep and could scarcely
keep our footing in that great rush of water. It was
only with the greatest care that we could possibly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-178" id="Pg_2-178"></a>[<a href="images/2-178.png">178</a>]</span>
accomplish the feat, and of this I warned my men.
In fact, the moment the canoe came down at an angle
on the steep incline she gave such a mighty jerk that
my men, with the exception of Alcides, let go the
ropes. Some of them had the skin taken clean off
their fingers. I saw the canoe give a great leap.
To my horror, a moment after the canoe had passed
me down the rapid&mdash;I was holding one of the ropes at
the lower part of the rapid&mdash;I saw Alcides, who bravely
had never let the rope go, being carried away in the
current. I just managed to grab him as he was about
to be drawn into the vortex, where most certainly he
would have lost his life. I lost my footing too, and we
were both thrown against a rock, which I grabbed with
one hand while still holding on to Alcides. There we
remained powerless for several minutes, swallowing a
good deal of water, which went right over our heads
with the resistance we made against the current, until
Filippe the negro&mdash;with wonderful courage, since he
was no swimmer&mdash;came to our rescue.</p>

<p>Alcides was undoubtedly a brave man, but he
certainly had a beastly temper. No sooner had he
recovered from the accident than I heard some of the
other men tell him that he had had a narrow escape
and would have died had I not gone to his rescue.
Shouting aloud so that I could hear his remark, he said
to the men: "Oh, the Englishman only came to my
rescue because there was no danger for him, as he could
swim, or else he would not have done it."</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill2-178.jpg"><img src="images/ill2-178_th.jpg" alt="Author and his Men in Water up to their Necks for an Entire Night endeavouring to save their Canoe, which in shooting a Rapid had become stuck between Rocks." title="Author and his Men in Water up to their Necks for an Entire Night endeavouring to save their Canoe, which in shooting a Rapid had become stuck between Rocks." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Author and his Men in Water up to their Necks for an Entire Night endeavouring to save their Canoe, which in shooting a Rapid had become stuck between Rocks.</p>
<hr />
<p>There was no time to lose, and certainly no time
for argument. The canoe had most unluckily got stuck
at the bottom of the rapid between two rocks, her fore-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-179" id="Pg_2-179"></a>[<a href="images/2-179.png">179</a>]</span>part
being absolutely submerged. The vibration was
such in the after-portion which stuck out of the water
that I thought any moment she might break in two.</p>

<p>All my men behaved that day with marvellous
courage&mdash;particularly Filippe, who, much delighted by
the words of praise I gave him when he risked his life
in coming to our rescue, now offered to risk his life once
more in endeavouring to seize one of the ropes which
had got loose and was dangling from the canoe in the
foaming waters. We tied Filippe with a rope which
we removed from one of the packing-cases we had
previously landed, and let him down the rapid until he
was thrown violently against the canoe. There the
plucky fellow was able to get inside and recover the
ropes, which he, after repeated attempts, flung on to
us. We pulled and pulled for several hours, but the
canoe was so jammed between the rocks, and the current
was so strong, that we were not able to get her off.</p>

<p>Night had come on, and we were still waist-deep in
the water and trembling with cold, trying to save
the canoe. She would not move in any direction. It
was with some concern that I had seen several articles
which had been loose in the canoe being washed out
into the water and disappearing in the whirlpool.
Then came a worse accident still. While trying to
unload two heavy cases of provisions&mdash;a ticklish job&mdash;the
men lost their footing in the current and one after
the other the packing-cases also disappeared in the
whirlpool.</p>

<p>All these disasters following one another within a
few hours were rather trying to us, the loss of the
provisions particularly giving me a great shock, as I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-180" id="Pg_2-180"></a>[<a href="images/2-180.png">180</a>]</span>
realized now that we had practically nothing else left
to eat except what we could find by shooting or fishing.</p>

<p>When the canoe had been made lighter we succeeded
by constantly jerking her in moving her slightly,
and eventually, at two o'clock in the morning&mdash;the
accident having occurred at half-past four in the afternoon&mdash;we
were able to release her and bring her to
safety along the bank.</p>

<p>A great hole had been opened in the side of the
canoe where she had struck the rock, and we had to
beach her in order to keep her afloat till the morning.
Then came the heavy task of taking all the baggage from
the rocks in the centre of the stream along the great
barrier of sharp cutting stones as far as the bank.</p>

<p class="fsc">The Salto Augusto from Above.</p>
<hr />
<p>We were prostrate with fatigue when we had accomplished
all the work. I lay down on the ground to
rest; my men fortunately had saved their hammocks,
as they were the first things they always took care
to save whenever there was a calamity. Not once
during the whole journey did my men offer me one
of their hammocks when they saw me sleeping with
great discomfort on packing-cases or on the ground.
Certainly I was too proud to ask them for any favour.</p>

<p>I had hardly gone to sleep when I thought I heard
a curious noise by my side, as of something dragging
along the ground. I immediately jumped up, and
saw a huge snake some 20 ft. long inquisitively looking
at me, only half a metre away. I do not know which of
us two was more surprised. The snake with sinuous
grace moved away from me with gradually accelerated
speed, and, passing right under the hammocks of my
men, disappeared in the forest behind.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-181" id="Pg_2-181"></a>[<a href="images/2-181.png">181</a>]</span>
Taking all things into consideration, that was a
night worth remembering. What was worst of all was
the fact that, with the excitement and the fatigue, I
had forgotten to wind the chronometer at the usual
hour of seven o'clock in the evening, and when I woke
up startled in the morning, remembering the fact, I
found the chronometer had stopped altogether. That
was the greatest blow of all, after all the trouble I had
taken to keep the Greenwich mean time for my observations
of longitude. The mishap was not irreparable,
as I got the time fairly accurately by using the
previous observations at local noon and working out
the difference with Greenwich mean time.</p>

<p>So many had been the obstacles we had found that
day that, before reaching the rapid where we had the
disaster, we had made a progress of 39 kil. 500 m.&mdash;poor
work indeed as compared to the wonderful distances
we had been able to cover on the first days of
our navigation of the Arinos River. Considering all,
however, it was really marvellous that we could cover
even that distance, short as it was.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> thermometer that night, July 30th, showed a
minimum of 63&deg; F. We repaired the large hole (about
1 ft. in diameter) in the side of the canoe by stuffing
it with a pair of my pyjamas, while one or two shirts
which I still had left were torn to shreds in order to
fill up the huge crack which went from one end of the
canoe almost to the other, and which had become
opened again in scraping rocks in the rapid.</p>

<p>We did not leave that camp until 11 o'clock a.m.
An isolated hill was visible on the left bank. We had
gone some 3,000 m. when we came to another fairly
strong rapid. My men were quarrelling among themselves.
Alcides, who was fond of gesticulating on such
occasions, let the steering gear go in order to give more
force to his words by waving his hands in the air,
regardless of the danger which was in front of us, with
the result that the canoe turned a pirouette upon herself
and down the rapid we went backwards.</p>

<p>The river flowed from that place in an easterly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-183" id="Pg_2-183"></a>[<a href="images/2-183.png">183</a>]</span>
direction for some 3,000 m., where a great basin was
formed, strewn with rocks and islets and having two
large islands in its eastern part. The basin in its
widest part had a width of 2,000 m. Then from that
point the river went to 50&deg; b.m. for a distance of
6,000 m. A strong north-easterly wind was blowing
against us, keeping us back and making our work unduly
hard. Great waves tossed us about and made
my men seasick, while we got splashed incessantly,
the moisture we absorbed being each time quickly
evaporated by the fierce wind. We felt cold and
shivery and not particularly happy after the experience
of the previous night.</p>

<p>Benedicto, who had been entrusted during the
journey with the baling out of the canoe, was beginning
to find his job too much for him&mdash;a job which he had
volunteered to do at first when the canoe was not
leaking. He now said he wanted to paddle and not
bale out the water any more. Although we used a
big bucket for that purpose, Benedicto had all his
work cut out for him in keeping the canoe only half
full of water.</p>

<p>Several times I remonstrated with him that day,
as while I was sitting behind him with the wind
blowing hard, he flung most of the water on me instead
of back into the stream.</p>

<p>I had observed for the last few days a little globular
white cloudlet to the north, just above the horizon.
Every day that cloudlet was to be seen in the very same
position, where it remained motionless most of the day
upon the otherwise beautifully clear blue sky. That
was an indication to me that we must be nearing a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-184" id="Pg_2-184"></a>[<a href="images/2-184.png">184</a>]</span>
great fall of water or an immense rapid, which caused
the evaporation of the water to produce it.</p>

<p>Many were the islands we passed that day, some as
much as 800 m. in length. One island, particularly,
was picturesque to a degree, with an impressive crown
of rock on its westerly side. The river was there some
2,000 m. wide&mdash;perhaps even more, as I could not
quite see how far the bank was to the left of us owing
to some islands which stood in the way.</p>

<p>A barrier of islands describing a crescent then stood
before us, the largest island of that group being 800 m.
wide and several kilometres long&mdash;Belinda Island. I
did not measure the exact length of this island, as we
got into great trouble there in some strong rapids, and
I had to leave my notebooks for a moment in order
to assist poor Benedicto in baling out the water so that
we could keep afloat.</p>

<p>When our course turned to 10&deg; b.m. we came into
full view of a high range to the north of us which
spread from north-west to south-east. The river had
cut its way right through it. We reached a great basin
again, 2,000 m. broad like its predecessor, with four
beautiful islands abreast, and a number of other islands
varying from 100 to 500 m. in length behind them, in
the centre, while rocks innumerable were scattered
about. There was a rapid once more, with a nasty
succession of strong whirlpools formed by the deviation
of the swift waters encountering the many rocks.</p>

<p class="fsc">The Upper Terrace of the August Waterfall.</p>
<hr />
<p>Beyond the rapids we got a full view of the range
before us, which extended from 90&deg; b.m. to 320&deg;. We
had hardly recovered from negotiating those eddies
when we were confronted by yet another strong rapid,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-185" id="Pg_2-185"></a>[<a href="images/2-185.png">185</a>]</span>
impossible to navigate, where we had to let the canoe
down by means of ropes.</p>

<p>The river here was most picturesque, in great
straight stretches from 3,000 to 9,000 m. in length.
Some 4,000 m. farther down we came to a very bad
rapid. My men were extremely tired of unloading and
reloading the canoe all the time with the heavy baggage
which still remained. They became most ill-tempered
when this new rapid appeared before us, blaming me, as
it were, for the rapid being there. I told them that
if they did not care to unload all they had to do was
to shoot the rapid. They quarrelled among themselves.
When we got near it my men became terrified.
Alcides, who was at the steering gear, mentioned the
fact that we should all be drowned in a few moments.
He became perplexed when we entered the rapid,
which tossed the canoe about in a merciless manner.
In one place, where the water, driven through with great
force along a narrow channel, formed a central wave
of great height, the canoe stood up almost vertically
on her stern. Baggage and men all slid down in a
heap. The next thing I saw, when the canoe righted
herself, was that we were going down the rapid sideways
and at a really vertiginous pace. We managed
to clear by a mere hair's-breadth two great rocks
which stood in the way. Had we struck a rock on
that particular occasion we certainly should have all
been killed. As luck would have it, before we knew
what was happening we were shot into the whirlpool
under the rapid, and there we turned round upon ourselves
three or four times before my men had recovered
from the amazement of finding themselves still alive,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-186" id="Pg_2-186"></a>[<a href="images/2-186.png">186</a>]</span>
and had begun to paddle again after I had told them
to do so for the twentieth time.</p>

<p>Filippe the negro exclaimed: "As long as we come
with you, sir, we shall never be killed, but you let us
go very near death sometimes!" Then they discussed
among themselves, saying that I must have some
particular mascotte which I carried upon my person
and which prevented disaster.</p>

<p>The range which was before us to the north-west
developed itself into a flat-topped hill mass about
500 ft. above the level of the river.</p>

<p>Another rapid, fairly violent, was reached some
distance beyond, my men this time offering at once,
of their own accord, to unload the canoe and take her
down carefully with ropes. I pretended not to care,
as I wanted to give them a lesson, and said we had
better shoot it, as we had done the previous one.</p>

<p>"No, no, no, no!" they all said in a chorus;
"there is such a thing as tempting Providence!"</p>

<p>As we got farther down I could perceive that the
range extended much farther than I had seen earlier
in the day; in fact, from the W.N.W. it spread as far
as E.S.E.</p>

<p>Below the last rapid was an island of great beauty&mdash;Babin
Island&mdash;2,000 m. long. The river beyond
that island formed two arms, one on each side of a
triangular island located in the opening formed in the
hill range by the river, where another strong rapid&mdash;in
fact, a regular small waterfall&mdash;was to be found.</p>

<p>It was very difficult to keep count of all the islands
which we constantly passed&mdash;many elongated, others
triangular, others rectangular, others of all kinds of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-187" id="Pg_2-187"></a>[<a href="images/2-187.png">187</a>]</span>
irregular shapes. In my note-books I endeavoured
to map out the entire course of the river as well as I
could, and I think that, considering the amount of
other work I had to do and the difficulties encountered
all the time, the map I made to the scale of one centimetre
to a kilometre is as accurate as it could possibly
be made with the means at my command. In places
where I was uncertain I have left blanks in the map,
and have not gone in for the usual method of certain
geographers of filling up the space with all kinds of
shadings in order to make it look pretty.</p>

<p>We had gone that day 46 kil., the current having
been very strong all the time, which made up for the
loss of time in dealing with the many rapids.</p>

<p>I took altitude observations with the hypsometrical
apparatus, water boiling at that spot at
210&deg; 3&frac12;, the temperature of the air being 78&deg; F.
The minimum temperature during the night of July 30th
was 63&deg; F.</p>

<p>We began our journey the next morning by going
down a bad rapid and across an awe-inspiring whirlpool.
There again we had to lead the empty canoe down
with ropes, and even so we had difficulty in getting
her through safely.</p>

<p>We were in a region of immense volcanic domes
composed of eroded rock, with many small perforations
and large holes 2 or 3 ft. in diameter, highly
polished inside as if they had been varnished. Those
rocks were similar to those I had met in the higher
part of the plateau of Matto Grosso. Some of the holes
in the rock had been enlarged to a great extent by the
water of the river revolving inside them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-188" id="Pg_2-188"></a>[<a href="images/2-188.png">188</a>]</span>
After we had passed the great whirlpool we found
many curious mounds of sand 20 ft. high among great
masses of lava and eruptive rock. Those mounds were
formed by musical sand such as we had met before.
We called it in this particular place "moaning sand,"
as instead of whistling as usual it produced a wailing
sound like the cry of a hungry puppy.</p>

<p>On the right side of the stream we came to an
important tributary 50 m. wide; 500 m. lower down
another strong rapid was reached. I was greatly
amused to see how my men now invariably pulled up
the canoe when we perceived a rapid and unloaded her,
carefully taking her down with ropes. One man,
nevertheless, had to be in the canoe to steer her.
Alcides always volunteered to take the job.</p>

<p class="fsc">Interesting Geological Formation below the Salto Augusto.</p>
<hr />
<p>Two hundred metres below this rapid the river
turned a sharp corner. There we met one of the most
dangerous rapids and whirlpool I have ever seen. It
was quite awe-inspiring to look at those vicious waters,
the water in the vortex being raised like a wall two or
three feet higher than the greatest waves of the rapid
by the force with which it revolved. The entire river&mdash;which,
as we have seen, was in some places 2,000 m.
wide&mdash;was now squeezed through a narrow cut in the
hill range, two great arms of water joining directly
above that spot. The water was naturally forced
through that small opening at an incredible pace.
The high vertical rocks at the side of the small channel
which was there formed made it extremely difficult to
take the canoe down by ropes, especially as the summit
of those rocks was much cut up, and we, above, could
not keep pace with the canoe as she floated swiftly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-189" id="Pg_2-189"></a>[<a href="images/2-189.png">189</a>]</span>
down the rapid. By fastening together a lot of ropes
which we had removed from round the different
packages we just managed to make them long enough
to undertake the dangerous task.</p>

<p>The hill range, a section of which could be seen at
that spot, clearly showed that it was made up of
gigantic blocks piled on the top of one another up
to a height of 100 ft. At high water the river level
must reach&mdash;as was evident by the erosion and other
signs upon those rocks&mdash;nearly to the summit of the
range; in fact, when I climbed to the top I found
plenty of d&eacute;bris among the rocks, undoubtedly left
there by the stream. On the north side the range
was made up entirely of gigantic slabs of lava some
15 ft. thick and lying at an angle of 60&deg; with a
dip northward. On the south side of the range I had
found, instead, great boulders which had evidently
travelled there and were much eroded. It can
easily be understood that when the water rose it
must be held up by the hill range, and form a big
lake.</p>

<p>We wasted an entire day trying to find a way to
take the canoe over the hills, as we did not dare risk
sending her down by water. My men were positively
disheartened and on the verge of revolt, as they contended
that it was all my fault that I had taken them
to a diabolical place like that. I plainly told them
that if I gave them such high wages it was because I
knew there was a great deal of risk, as I had explained
to them at the beginning of the expedition, and I
expected them to do some hard work in return.</p>

<p>"But," said the philosopher of the party, "what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-190" id="Pg_2-190"></a>[<a href="images/2-190.png">190</a>]</span>
is the use of money to us if after working hard for
months and months we are going to be killed?"</p>

<p>I told them that that was not the moment to argue,
but to act; if they followed my orders closely, perhaps
we might all escape alive.</p>

<p>Alcides, who was certainly a hard worker, although
not always in the right direction, had a nasty accident
that day and cut his foot badly on the sharp rocks.
He was practically incapacitated for work, as he could
only stand on one leg, the other leg being contracted
with the really ghastly injury.</p>

<p>This was ill-luck, as our strength combined was not
sufficient for the work we had to do, and now the loss
of one man&mdash;the best of my followers&mdash;was an extra
trial at the most inopportune moment.</p>

<p>The canoe, too, was in a wretched condition after
all the many accidents we had had, and we possessed
no more tar, and could spare no more clothes, to stop
up the leakages which were now plentiful all over her
bottom.</p>

<p>The day of July 31st was thus absolutely lost. I
was on the verge of abandoning the canoe there
altogether and attempting to get down along the banks
of the river on foot&mdash;which would have been almost
suicidal, as we never could have reached a place of
safety.</p>

<p>Night came. At sunset we had the usual concert
of mosquitoes, all kinds of insects and frogs, in such
innumerable quantities that the din made by them
collectively was so loud as to resemble the sound of an
iron foundry or a battle-ship in course of construction,
the sounds produced by the millions of nocturnal singers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-191" id="Pg_2-191"></a>[<a href="images/2-191.png">191</a>]</span>
being quite metallic and reproducing exactly the sound
of hammers driving rivets into the steel plates of a
ship. Whether it was done purposely or accidentally
I do not know, but those little water creatures of the
Arinos seemed to keep excellent time, their vigour
also being most enviable.</p>

<p>On August 1st we had a minimum temperature of
64&deg; F. during the night.</p>

<p>I still saw that it was out of the question to endeavour
to take the canoe over the immense boulders
and over the hill range. One faint hope, involving
very great danger, loomed in my mind. If we could
only cross the river just above the fearsome channel we
could perhaps on the other side take down the canoe
by water. This plan required great smartness, as,
had we miscalculated the speed of the river and the
rate at which we could travel across that dangerous
water, it would surely mean certain death.</p>

<p>I spoke to my men about it. They said they were
ready to go. I explained to them that they must
paddle their hardest and not give way for a second
until we had got diagonally across the fairly still waters
only a few yards above the awful channel. Should
we by misfortune be dragged into that channel by the
current we might as well say good-bye to the world.</p>

<p>When we started on that job we risked everything.
My men behaved splendidly that day. They paddled
and paddled for all they were worth, to get across
the hundred metres or so, and took the best part of
half an hour in the formidable current. For a moment,
when the canoe was in the centre where the current
was strongest and we were making no headway, I saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-192" id="Pg_2-192"></a>[<a href="images/2-192.png">192</a>]</span>
a bad look-out for us. I urged them on with shouts of
"<i>Rema! rema!</i>" (Row! row!) and at last, in a desperate
effort, the canoe once more moved forward.
It was a relief indeed when men and baggage were
safely landed on the opposite side.</p>

<p>All were so exhausted that for a couple of hours
it was out of the question to resume work. I occupied
that time in taking observations for altitude and
longitude, tortured to death as usual by the innumerable
bees and <i>piums</i>. (Lat. 8&deg; 54&#8242;&middot;6 S.; long.
58&deg; 51&#8242; W.)</p>

<p>The temperature in the sun was 107&deg; F. The red
and black volcanic rocks radiated such heat that we
were nearly stifled in the enclosed basin which was
formed by the hill range.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we began with the second part
of the dangerous task of endeavouring to take the
canoe through the current in a north-easterly direction.
The channel in that cut was 200 m. long and only
50 m. wide.</p>

<p>The rock was laminated in layers 6 ft. thick, which
had been subsequently baked into a solid mass. The
lower portion, of beautiful black and quite shiny,
threw up by contrast the vivid red colour of the
upper part.</p>

<p class="fsc">The Salto Augusto (Upper Terrace).</p>
<hr />
<p>We had an exciting time when we started the canoe
with ropes down that rapid. We ran with bare feet
upon the sharp broiling rocks. We could not possibly
stand on them with our shoes on. We ran along for
all we were worth, in order to prevent the canoe escaping.
We climbed up and down great cuts from 10 to
30 ft. high in the rock, never letting go the ropes. Our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-193" id="Pg_2-193"></a>[<a href="images/2-193.png">193</a>]</span>
agility that day was remarkable. Even poor Alcides,
whose foot I had wrapped up with a piece of my shirt,
was coming along pluckily, regardless of the pain
which he certainly suffered. Once or twice, when we
remained slightly behind in that awful race, the canoe
nearly pulled us into the water from our high point on
the rocks some 30 to 50 ft. above.</p>

<p>Those 200 m. of channel seemed miles long to us.
Eventually, the canoe was brought out safely at the
other end. With bleeding feet and hands we returned
once more to our point of departure in order to convey
all our baggage upon our backs. After two or three
journeys backwards and forwards we were able to
proceed a short distance down the river, where we
could find a suitable camping-place to rest our weary
bones for the night.</p>

<p>On leaving the rapids the river took a direction of
310&deg; b.m. There was a high hill to the east and
another, equally high, to the west. The chain of hills
seen from the north showed much erosion in the centre,
where the rock was exposed underneath. On the
south side the upper portion of the hill range consisted
of a vertical rocky cliff in strata each 6 ft. thick.</p>

<p>Another cut, more unpleasant even than ours, had
been made by the river in that same range to the
north-east of that through which we had taken the
canoe. An island of rock rose between those cuts.</p>

<p>A few hundred metres below the mouth of that
ugly channel we found an extensive beach, on which
we made our camp for the night. The minimum
temperature during the night of August 2nd was 64&deg; F.</p>

<p>When we landed the men were proceeding to cut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-194" id="Pg_2-194"></a>[<a href="images/2-194.png">194</a>]</span>
down the foliage on the edge of the forest, so as to be
able to hang their hammocks, when they became
greatly excited on discovering several nests of <i>maribondos</i>
(hornets), graceful cones of a parchment-like
material enclosing a number of superposed discs from
one to three inches in diameter and about a quarter of
an inch apart. Each disc had a perforation in order
to let the dwellers in those little homes pass from one
chamber to another from the highest of the cone down
to the lowest in the apex.</p>

<p>When we left at 7.30 in the morning and had gone
but 1,800 m., the river suddenly described a sharp
angle and at that point went through a narrow neck.
Afterwards it widened once more to an average
breadth of 800 m., which it kept for a distance
of 3 kil. in a straight line, the channel being there
quite clear of rocks and the water beautifully smooth.</p>

<p>The river was indeed lovely in that part. I had a
little more time there to look round at the scenery on
either side of us. I noticed that rubber was still to be
found, but in small quantities in that region. Rubber
trees were only to be seen every now and then. Looking
back to the south and south-west on the range of
hills we had left behind, I could see that it extended
far to the north-west. The highest part of it, however,
seemed to be near the point where we had
negotiated the dangerous rapid.</p>

<p>We had gone no more than 9,600 m., when we came
to another bad rapid over a barrier of rock across the
river from north-east to south-west. A tributary 10 m.
wide at the mouth occurred on the right just before
this rapid. Beautiful trees of great height, with yellow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-195" id="Pg_2-195"></a>[<a href="images/2-195.png">195</a>]</span>
ball-like blooms, enlivened the scenery as we went
along. We had little time to appreciate the beauty
of the vegetation&mdash;we were too busy with the river.
No sooner had we got through one rapid than we
came to another alarming one, with a sudden drop of
over 6 ft. and enormous volumes of water pouring
over it.</p>

<p>This rapid described an arc of a circle, forming an
awe-inspiring whirlpool below the actual fall. We had
some trouble in finding a place where we could get the
canoe through. Eventually, with water up to our
necks, we let her gradually down the high step in the
middle of the river, we standing with great difficulty
on submerged rocks. We had then to make several
journeys backwards and forwards to convey the
various loads to the canoe after we had brought her to
a place of safety, our baggage having been left on rocks
in mid-stream. This was extremely risky work, for the
current was powerful and the water reached in some
places up to our necks. I was anxious for the men
who could not swim, as I was afraid any moment they
might be washed away, and not only should I lose
them but also the valuable instruments, photographic
plates, etc., which they were conveying across.</p>

<p>Again that day I had seen since the early morning
our friend the little white solitary cloudlet, standing
out motionless against the otherwise speckless blue sky.
Not only that, but on that particular day I could just
perceive, directly under that cloudlet, a faint column
of white mist connecting it vertically with the ground.
I knew by that sign that we could not be far off a big
waterfall; in fact, I could hear a distant rumble which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-196" id="Pg_2-196"></a>[<a href="images/2-196.png">196</a>]</span>
made me suspect that we were much nearer than we
supposed.</p>

<p>The river was flowing to 70&deg; b.m. Two other
rapids&mdash;most violent&mdash;were reached within a short
distance of each other; then, shortly beyond these
obstacles, where the river described a graceful turn,
we had before us a great surprise. We heard a loud
roar like thunder; it had been getting louder and
louder, and grew quite deafening when we turned round
the corner. Behold! we had no more scenery upon
the horizon before us on the river, but the sky came
right down to the water. Great clouds of mist rose
up in quick succession in graceful circles. There was
an island in the centre of the stream; then to the left
of the island the sky again came right down to the
water. There a curious effect was to be seen, a high
pointed cone of water shooting up skyward with
terrific force, then rolling upon itself only to give way
to another cone of water succeeding it.</p>

<p class="fsc">Foliated Rock below the August Falls.</p>
<hr />
<p>My men were terrified when they suddenly realized
the danger which was only a few hundred metres in
front of us. There was a mighty waterfall. When
my men got excited it was generally troublesome, because
they always disagreed and started quarrelling
and insulting one another. Some of them wanted to
land at once, for fear of being dragged down the fall.
Alcides&mdash;who wanted to show his bravery on all
occasions&mdash;said there was no danger at all and we
could go in the canoe right as far as the edge of the
fall. The others naturally got somewhat scared at so
foolhardy a project. Personally I did not like to say
a word in the matter, for fear they should think that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-197" id="Pg_2-197"></a>[<a href="images/2-197.png">197</a>]</span>
was afraid. I saw with some concern that Alcides&mdash;whose
mind, I believe, was not quite right owing to
the hardships we had endured of late&mdash;was steering
us right for the centre of the waterfall. I told him
that it would be preferable to land on the edge of the
waterfall rather than go over it, as it was a little too
high for the canoe to tumble over. I calculated the
height of the fall from 40 to 50 ft., and I was not far
wrong, for when I took accurate measurements I
found the actual height was 48 ft.</p>

<p>We were beginning to drift very speedily with the
current, when Alcides, realizing the danger, steered us
toward the right bank. The men paddled for their
lives so as to land as quickly as possible, as we were
now less than a hundred metres from the portentous
jump. The current was terrific, and the canoe was
floating sideways nearer and nearer the awful chasm.
The coast line on the right, was almost vertical, and
there was no place where we could hold on to anything
and land. So down floated the canoe, my men horror-stricken.
Once or twice they were able to seize a creeping
vine hanging down the steep bank, endeavouring to
stop the canoe's headlong career. But the creepers
gave way and crashed down upon us, nearly turning
over the canoe at the moment just before they snapped.</p>

<p>So down, down we went, until we were now only a
few metres from the fatal drop, and I saw no way of
arresting the canoe.</p>

<p>"Estamos perdidos!" (We are lost!) shouted the
men.</p>

<p>"Not yet! not yet!" I exclaimed, as I perceived
two rocks just sticking out of the water. "Make for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-198" id="Pg_2-198"></a>[<a href="images/2-198.png">198</a>]</span>
the rocks!" I shouted to Alcides, and just as we
shaved past them I jumped quickly on one of the
rocks, holding the canoe, while two of the men also
jumped out quickly and held fast to the boat&mdash;just in
time. We were only 10 or 15 m. from the place where
the water curled over and rolled down the fall.</p>

<p>There was no time for arguing or scolding. Upon
those rocks my men, who were fond of talking, started
a brisk war of words, saying that they would
never continue the journey if Alcides were allowed to
steer again. Alcides, on the other hand, whose only
aim in life was to fight everybody and everything,
invited all the other men to a duel with their rifles. I
told them they could have the duel after we had
finished the journey and not before. We must take
the ropes, climb up to the top of the bank, and, first
of all, we must tow the canoe back to a place of safety.</p>

<p>After a great deal of shouting, angry words and
oaths, absolutely deadened by the thundering roar of
the waterfall, they took out the ropes and eventually
towed the canoe back. As soon as that was done I
went with my camera to gaze at the beautiful sight
and photograph it from different points&mdash;a job which
was not easy, as the waterfall was so encased between
vertical rocky walls (foliated in horizontal strata,
which varied in thickness from a quarter of an inch to
one foot) that it was impossible to get far enough back
to obtain a full view of it.</p>

<p>That fall, called the August Fall, was indeed a
grand sight. As I have already said, it was divided
into two separate falls, between which was an island
with a great spur of rock forming a wall between the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-199" id="Pg_2-199"></a>[<a href="images/2-199.png">199</a>]</span>
two cascades. The water flowed over that wall in
graceful steps. The fall on the right side of which I
stood was in two immense horseshoe-shaped terraces.
The continuation of those terraces on each side of the
great flow of water formed tiers of red and black volcanic
rock lying in horizontal strata so regular as to
be not unlike a gigantic Etruscan amphitheatre. The
upper tier of the fall on the right formed an arc not
less than 300 m. in periphery. The lower crescent
formed an arc 400 m. in length.</p>

<p>Upon this lower terrace the rebounding waters
were thrown up with great force into the air&mdash;the spray
forming numerous rainbows in the sun&mdash;only to drop
down once more in most contorted, diabolical curves,
boiling and roaring in their endeavour to force their
way through that positive inferno.</p>

<p>As the water came down in great volumes over
those two crescents it met once more in the centre in
a mighty clash, being flung up at a tremendous height
in the air. I do not know that I have ever seen such
a fearsome sight, or that I have ever seen water rush
with such force anywhere before. It seemed a pity
that there was no one to harness that waterfall and
use the enormous power it could generate.</p>

<p>On the left side of the river also the waterfall made
an amphitheatre of rock somewhat smaller than the
right fall. Down below, at the foot of this, it formed
huge masses of white foam, above which profuse spray
rose up like a heavy mist. Just beyond was disclosed
a diabolical whirlpool, far beyond words to describe,
which extended&mdash;as white as snow with the amount of
foam it carried, twisting and retwisting in a thousand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-200" id="Pg_2-200"></a>[<a href="images/2-200.png">200</a>]</span>
circles on the surface&mdash;for over 500 m. from the lower
step of the waterfall.</p>

<p>I measured the height of the fall with a string.
The exact height of the upper terrace was 6 m. 90 cm.;
the height of the lower terrace, 7 m. 73 cm.&mdash;or a total
height of 14 m. 63 cm.</p>

<p>I also took the differential height with the several
aneroids I possessed, and the elevation with the boiling-point
thermometers above the fall and below, with a
result of 48 ft. for the actual height of the fall.</p>

<p class="fsc">Formation of Rock below the August Falls.</p>
<hr />
<p>One fact was certain, and that was that the canoe
could not possibly go down by water. There was
only one way to get out of that difficulty; that was
by taking the canoe overland until we could find a
navigable spot in the river down below. To make
things worse, there was a hill range on the right bank of
the river, on which we were. I must find a way to
make the canoe go over that hill range&mdash;that was all.</p>

<p>The canoe, I might remind the reader, was 42 ft.
long and 3&frac12; ft. wide, of heavy solid wood, her bottom
being over a foot thick, her sides from 3 to 5 in. in
thickness, her stern and prow, roughly carved out, of
great thickness also. I calculated her weight at over
2,000 lb., which was well under her actual weight.</p>

<p>I spoke to my men, and told them that we must
take the canoe over the hill range. They had been
very morose since our arrival at that spot, as they expected
me to give ourselves up for lost when we came
to what they believed to be an insuperable obstacle.
They mutinied at once and took to their rifles, saying
that they would not follow a lunatic any farther, a
man who asked them to take a canoe over a hill.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-201" id="Pg_2-201"></a>[<a href="images/2-201.png">201</a>]</span>
"Do you not know," said one of them to me, with
a fierce grin of contempt upon his face, "that canoes
are made for the water and not to travel over mountains?"</p>

<p>"Do you not know," shouted Alcides, shaking his
fist, "that it would take a hundred strong men to
lift that canoe one inch above the water?&mdash;and we,
including you, are only seven men, tired and worn.... You
believe that because you are English you can do
what you like. You will next ask the moon to come
and row in our canoe so that we may get along! You
have gone insane."</p>

<p>"Yes, he is mad!" they all said in a chorus. "We
want the balance of our pay and we will leave you at
once. Give us our money and we will go&mdash;we want
to go."</p>

<p>I told them that they could have their money as
soon as the canoe had gone over the hill and down
the other side, and certainly not before. They could
shoot me if they liked, but that would not help them
very much, as I knew the way to get on and they
did not. If they shot me they would perhaps die of
starvation themselves soon. I agreed that it was a
beautiful spot to die in, and perhaps they could hasten
their departure by jumping into the fall, and thus end
all the hardships, and, at least, arguments.</p>

<p>After those words, which I had spoken with gentleness,
I turned, and&mdash;for the first time since they had
been with me&mdash;in a stern tone of voice I ordered
Filippe and Antonio to take their big knives and proceed
to cut down ten or twelve of the straightest trees
they could find. They refused. I quietly walked to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-202" id="Pg_2-202"></a>[<a href="images/2-202.png">202</a>]</span>
the rifle which I generally used for shooting game, and
inserted in it a clip of five cartridges. I cocked the
rifle, and, placing my watch before me on a stone, gave
the men five minutes to decide whether they would
cut the trees or be shot. I also said that if any of them
moved their rifles they would have a bullet put through
them.</p>

<p>Filippe and Antonio dropped their rifles on the
ground, reluctantly took the knives and walked
away, I pointing out to them the tall trees which I
wanted cut. I then ordered Alcides to take one of
the axes and cut thirty rollers, each about 5 ft. long.
The men were silent and yellow-faced with rage.</p>

<p>The trees in that region were easily cut down.
After a few minutes down came a tree with a crash,
and shortly after another. I walked to the men and
patted them on the back, assuring them again that
if they obeyed my orders we should soon proceed on
our journey and should certainly arrive safely at a
point where they could return home and be happy.</p>

<p>Alcides thereupon turned round asking me whether
I intended them to cut down the entire forest and
then request them to pierce a tunnel through the hill
range&mdash;or perhaps I might want the whole hill range
flattened down for my convenience!</p>

<p>I paid no attention, but ordered him to cut sixty
rollers instead of thirty. I had to keep a sharp watch
on my men that day, and I had fully decided, if any
disobedience took place, I would shoot them. I think
they thoroughly realized that, because they carried
out all my instructions to the letter.</p>

<p>When that job was done I explored the district<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-203" id="Pg_2-203"></a>[<a href="images/2-203.png">203</a>]</span>
carefully, in order to discover which was the easiest point
over which the canoe could be made to climb the hill
range. Having found a way which I thought suitable, I
myself took one of the large knives, and ordered the
other men to come with me with all the implements
we could use in order to clear a sufficiently wide road
through which the canoe could pass. This work lasted
many hours, and was certainly trying.</p>

<p>On August 3rd we worked the entire day, from
sunrise until seven in the evening, cutting a way
through the forest. Then, when we had done that,
I constructed, with the longer trees we had cut down,
a small railway from the water, where the canoe was.
I used the rollers on these rails made of the smoothest
trees I could find. When my men grasped the idea&mdash;of
which they had never dreamed&mdash;they became very
excited and in a good humour. They worked extremely
hard. It was a portentous effort to get the
canoe on to the first roller, but once we had got her
on the first and second and third rollers, and were able
to lift her stern out of the water with levers and
pieces of wood we gradually placed under her, she
began to move along on the rollers with comparative
ease. We moved the rails in front as we went along,
and all went well until we got to the foot of the hill.</p>

<p>There the trouble began: first of all because it
was difficult to keep the rollers in position on the
rails; then also because the moment we started to
push the canoe up the hill she would slide back almost
as far as, and sometimes farther than, we had pushed
her up. By a judicious use of ropes which we made
fast to trees on either side, and by a careful study of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-204" id="Pg_2-204"></a>[<a href="images/2-204.png">204</a>]</span>
the laws of leverage, we managed to push up the canoe
a few inches at a time. We had some narrow escapes
once or twice, when the ropes, under the excessive
strain, snapped, and the canoe slid down again, dragging
us with her. One tree, to which one of the ropes
was fastened, broke, and in its fall just missed killing
a man.</p>

<p>When once we had begun pushing the canoe up
that hill we could not leave her for a moment, as she
would at once proceed to slide back on the rollers.</p>

<p>Fourteen hours' incessant hard work saw us and the
canoe on the top of the hill. From there we had before
us a very steep descent of some 400 ft., the first 150 ft.
almost vertical.</p>

<p>My men all looked at me in a most inquisitive
way in order to find out how I should manage to
hold the canoe when we let her down that steep
incline.</p>

<p>I had fastened some pieces of wood vertically at
her stern, which, by scraping on the ground, would
hold her to a certain extent. Then, with all the ropes
we possessed we made her fast to the trees as we went
along, and let her slide gently, the weight of the canoe
being such that deep grooves were actually cut into
the trees as the ropes unwound themselves.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill2-204.jpg"><img src="images/ill2-204_th.jpg" alt="Photograph showing the Road cut by Author across the Forest in order to take the Heavy Canoe Overland." title="Photograph showing the Road cut by Author across the Forest in order to take the Heavy Canoe Overland." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Photograph showing the Road cut by Author across the Forest in order to take the Heavy Canoe Overland.</p>
<hr />
<p>We were only half-way down that incline when
one tree broke. The canoe gave a leap on one side,
knocking down Antonio and the man X, the jerk
immediately after breaking another tree on the opposite
side. Off went the canoe down the hill in her mad
career, knocking some of us down, dragging the others,
who were holding on to her. Two or three men were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-205" id="Pg_2-205"></a>[<a href="images/2-205.png">205</a>]</span>
badly thrown about, but fortunately no broken bones
were recorded. The canoe by that time had, in great
leaps, reached nearly the bottom of the hill, but had
got so jammed between a rock and a big tree that it
required several hours' hard work with our axes and
knives in order to disentangle her.</p>

<p>The shock, however, had been too great for the
rickety canoe. I became anxious, for I feared she
might split in two at any time, and I had no way
of repairing her properly. When we got to the water
again I patched her up as best I could with improvised
nails which I made from pieces of hard wood. With
great yells of excitement from my men we launched
her once more in the river.</p>

<p>My men boasted how clever they had been to take
the heavy canoe over the hill. There was really nothing
Brazilians could not do when they wished!</p>

<p>Those forty hours of steady hard work out of the
forty-eight hours we had stopped at the falls had seen
us over that obstacle, and we were now ready to proceed
once more by water.</p>

<p>We had suffered a great deal during those terrible
hours from the bees, mosquitoes, hornets, <i>piums</i>, ants,
and all kinds of other insects which stung us all over.
A glance at the photographs which illustrate this
volume, of the canoe being taken across the forest,
will show all my men&mdash;I, naturally, not appearing, as
I was taking the photographs&mdash;with their heads wrapped
up in towels, notwithstanding the great heat, in order
to avoid the unbearable torture as much as possible.</p>

<p>The minimum temperature during the night of
August 3rd had been 61&deg; F.; during the night of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-206" id="Pg_2-206"></a>[<a href="images/2-206.png">206</a>]</span>
August 4th 72&deg; F. During the day the temperature
was 88&deg; F. in the shade, but the air was quite stifling,
as the sky was overcast with heavy clouds.</p>

<p>I took careful observations for latitude and longitude
in order to fix exactly the position of the great
falls. The latitude was 8&deg; 51&#8242;&middot;1 S.; the longitude
58&deg; 50&#8242; W.</p>

<p>The whirlpool and eddies which extended for
1,000 m. below the great fall were formidable. Never
in my life have I seen waters so diabolical. They filled
one absolutely with terror as one looked at them.</p>

<p>The river flowed there to bearings magnetic 120&deg;;
then to 140&deg; b.m. for 3,000 m., where it was comparatively
smooth. To the south-east of us was a
hill range fully 600 ft. high. What appeared to me to
be a small tributary seemed to enter the river on the
left, but my men were so tired that I did not cross
over to the other side in order to make certain. On
looking behind us I could see that the hill range at the
fall extended from north-west to south-east, while
another smaller hill range, only 250 ft. above the level
of the river, stretched from north to south on the left
of the stream. The river was 300 m. wide.</p>

<p>We went no more than 9,200 m. that day.</p>

Channel&mdash;Nothing to Eat&mdash;Another Disaster</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> had halted on a lovely island&mdash;Adelaide Island&mdash;with
a rocky and sandy extension. The night of
August 5th had been stifling, with a minimum temperature
of 72&deg; F.</p>

<p>I found my work too much for me now. There
was too much to observe on all sides. We were travelling
quickly with the swift current. A hill range from
east to west, 300 ft. high, ran along the left bank.
Farther, where the river went to the north-east for
4,000 m., laminated rock like slate showed through the
left bank, especially in a semicircular indentation
which had been eroded by the water. There a
strong whirlpool had formed. Another great stretch of
river, 5,500 m., was now before us, with a small hill
80 ft. high on the right bank. The river next formed
a circular basin with three islets and a barrier 500 m.
across.</p>

<p>We were now in a region where, fortunately for us,
<i>castanheiro</i> trees (<i>vulgo.</i> the "Para chestnut") were
to be found. Fish was scarce in the river. Now
that we had almost superhuman work to accomplish,
our meals were extremely scanty owing to the loss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-208" id="Pg_2-208"></a>[<a href="images/2-208.png">208</a>]</span>
of our provisions, and we had not sufficient food to
keep up our strength.</p>

<p>As we went on I saw to the north-east of us another
hill-range 300 ft. high, extending from north-west
to south-east, like most of the ranges found in that
region. Where a prominent headland stood on the
left side, with a hill 250 ft. high upon it, the river
turned to 30&deg; b.m. The hill was made up of foliated
rock lying in strata that varied from one inch to one
foot in thickness.</p>

<p>On the right side of the stream great cubic blocks
of rock rested on the polished curves of a huge dome
of granite. A quantity of d&eacute;bris stretched from south
to north right across the basin, and caused a deviation
in the stream.</p>

<p class="fsc">Conveying the Canoe across the Forest on an Improvised Railway and Rollers.</p>
<hr />
<p>A terrific rapid with a sheer drop of 3 ft. was
situated here. A double whirlpool of great magnitude
was formed at the bottom of the rapid, the water revolving
with such force that the concavity was gradually
depressed for some 3 ft. and had a great hole
in each centre. We shot that rapid. As Alcides on
that occasion followed my instructions, the canoe shot
past between the two whirlpools, and although even then
she nearly capsized, we were able to continue, my men
shrieking with merriment at what they now believed to
be their invulnerability. We dodged the unpleasant eddies
while we floated with great speed in the strong current.</p>

<p>The river, which had contracted that day to 250 m.,
now expanded once more into a large basin 1,200 m.
wide and 1,800 m. long, with most troublesome eddies
as we went through it. The river described a great
turn from N.N.E. to 180&deg; b.m. or due south.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-209" id="Pg_2-209"></a>[<a href="images/2-209.png">209</a>]</span>
To add to the pleasures of our existence, we came
in for a heavy rain-storm that day, with deafening
thunder and blinding lightning. Notwithstanding the
great discomfort it caused us, it pleased me very much
because of the wonderful effects of light it produced
on the river.</p>

<p>Where the stream, in a course which had wriggled
like a snake, turned once more due north to 360&deg; b.m.,
it divided itself into two small channels. High waves
were produced where the water, pushed by the wind,
was forced against the rapid. There was a good drop
in the level of the river at that rapid, and it was a
nasty place indeed for us to go through. We got tossed
about, splashed all over, but we came out of it all the
same, amid the wildly excited yells of my men. They
were beginning to think that they were the greatest
navigators that had ever lived, and they never let an
opportunity pass of reminding each other of that fact.</p>

<p>I halted in the middle of the day to take the usual
observations for latitude and longitude (lat. 8&deg; 47&#8242;&middot;5
S.; long. 58&deg; 39&#8242; W.), but I was interrupted in my
work by another heavy rain-storm, which came and
drenched us once more. After that dense clouds as
black as ink covered the entire sky for the whole
afternoon. We were now in the rainy season. Terrific
gusts preceded these rain-storms, and were most
troublesome to us.</p>

<p>After negotiating the bad rapids, the river went
through a basin of boulders of broken foliated rock.
There were three small channels. Then beyond,
the entire river was forced through a rocky channel
from 35 to 40 m. wide, the water rushing through with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-210" id="Pg_2-210"></a>[<a href="images/2-210.png">210</a>]</span>
incredible force on a steep gradient until half-way
down the channel, where it actually ran uphill for 50 m.
or so, so great was the impetus it had received on its
rapid descent to that point.</p>

<p>You can well imagine what a pleasant job it was
for us to convey the canoe along with ropes over so
delightful a spot. Owing to our insufficient food, our
strength had greatly diminished. The ropes we had
used on the many rapids were now half-rotted and tied
up in innumerable knots. Moreover, the banks of
sharp cutting rock were of great height, and our ropes
were not long enough to be used separately, so that
we decided to use only one long rope made up of all
the ropes we possessed tied together. To make matters
more difficult, the channel was not perfectly straight,
but described two or three sharp corners, where the
water was thrown with much vigour in one direction,
then, being driven off immediately at a different angle,
curled over itself, producing mountains of foaming
water forty or fifty feet in height, and leaving great
depressions near the inner corner.</p>

<p>We cut down some long poles, and I placed one
man with a big pole on guard at each corner close
to the water, in order to push the canoe away toward
the middle of the stream in case she came too near
those dangerous points.</p>

<p>That channel was some 600 m. long. When we
were ready we let the canoe go, all spare hands holding
fast to the rope, running and scrambling up and
down and along the high rocky cliff, the canoe giving
us violent jerks when the direction of the current was
changed. With much alarm we saw her spring up in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-211" id="Pg_2-211"></a>[<a href="images/2-211.png">211</a>]</span>
the air like a flying-fish on one or two occasions. We
ran along like mad, out of breath and sweating, trying
to keep ahead of the canoe. The two men with poles
also ran along after the danger points were passed, so
as to shove her along when she came too near other
dangerous rocks.</p>

<p>After a race of great excitement, we all, with
bleeding feet and hands&mdash;the palms of our hands
actually blistered by the rope which slid through our
tightly closed fists&mdash;were eventually able to pull the
canoe safely on shore below the rapid.</p>

<p>In that mad flight I found time to pull out the
camera for one second and take a snapshot of the
canoe in the middle of the rapid. The photograph
is reproduced among the illustrations of this volume.</p>

<p>My men were so tired that it was impossible to go
on. Moreover we had before us the second section of
that formidable rapid, and we could not negotiate this
without emptying the canoe, which was full of water,
and readjusting the rope.</p>

<p>We spent the night of August 6th on those rocks,
the minimum temperature being 63&deg; F.</p>

<p>When we went on with our dangerous work the
next morning we had the greatest difficulty in saving
the canoe, as in entering the whirlpool she was swamped,
and it was all we could do to pull her back towards
the bank before she foundered altogether. The actual
drop in that rapid was not less than 8 ft. vertically.
We just managed to rest her on a submerged rock until
we were able to bale some of the water out.</p>

<p>That canoe was really wonderful in a way. My
men patted her on the prow as if she had been an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-212" id="Pg_2-212"></a>[<a href="images/2-212.png">212</a>]</span>
animal, and said she was a good canoe. Indeed she
was, but in her old age she felt the strain of that
exciting journey. Every time I looked at her I did
not know how much longer she might last. Whatever
may be said of them, my men must be given credit for
their courage in going along in that canoe. I do not
believe that there are six other men in Brazil&mdash;or
perhaps in any other country&mdash;who would have ventured
to go across even the most placid pond in a
similar craft.</p>

<p>After the rapids came a great basin 1,000 m. long,
800 m. wide. There the river described an angle from
20&deg; b.m. to 45&deg; b.m., and we perceived two parallel
ranges before us to the N.N.E., the farther one much
higher than the one nearer. Some 5 kil. beyond was yet
another rapid, but not so troublesome a one this
time. The river there diverged from north-east to a
direction due west. A hill range, from 150 to 250 ft.
high, extended from W.S.W. to E.N.E. An isolated
hill, 300 ft. high, could be seen to the E.N.E.</p>

<p>We suffered agony that day from regular clouds of
<i>borrachudos</i>, terrible little sand mosquitoes which made
life an absolute burden in that region. Our faces,
arms, and legs were a mass of ink-black marks left by
the stings of those vicious brutes. Particularly when
our hands were occupied in holding the canoe going
down rapids, or busy with dangerous jobs, did swarms
of those little rascals attack us with indomitable fury.</p>

<p class="fsc">Pushing the Canoe Uphill through the Forest.</p>
<p class="figcenter">(Notice men with heads wrapped owing to torturing insects.)</p>
<hr />
<p>Another basin was met, 700 m. wide, quite shallow,
and with rapids over a barrier of rock extending across
it from south-west to north-east. That barrier was
most interesting, because in many places great lava-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-213" id="Pg_2-213"></a>[<a href="images/2-213.png">213</a>]</span>flows
were visible; in other places masses of ferruginous
rock could be observed, with most extraordinary
patterns upon them&mdash;triangles, rectangles, trapeziums,
and all kinds of other angular geometrical patterns,
such as we had met before on the high plateau of Matto
Grosso.</p>

<p>We stopped in the middle of the day on an island
1,200 m. long, from which we obtained a fine view of
the hill range looming before us from W.S.W. to E.N.E.
on the right bank.</p>

<p>I was having great trouble with my chronometer,
which the many jerks, falls, and baths did not seem to
improve. I checked it whenever I could by observations
of local time and by other watches which I carried.
But all my instruments were beginning to feel the
effects of that journey very much. The wonder to
me was that they had got so far in as good condition
as they were, considering all we had gone
through.</p>

<p>Our lunch was speedy, as we had nothing to
eat. The moment I had finished my observations
for latitude and longitude we started off once more,
my men keeping their eyes all the time on the forest
on the look-out for nut-trees, the river that day giving
us no fish at all.</p>

<p>Within ten minutes we had shot two powerful
rapids, and in one place went over a dangerous submerged
wall of rock extending across the river from
E.S.E. to W.N.W.</p>

<p>The men&mdash;very hungry&mdash;were extremely quarrelsome
that day and insulting to one another. The canoe
went broadside down a rapid we met, the men gesticu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-214" id="Pg_2-214"></a>[<a href="images/2-214.png">214</a>]</span>lating
instead of paddling along as they should have
done. With a great bump we stuck with a heavy list
to starboard on a rock in the middle of the rapid, and
presently the canoe was filled with water. Had we not
stuck fast on that rock we certainly should have
capsized. The water was baled out in due course,
the canoe was floated once more. Soon afterwards
another strong rapid, with a <i>pedraria</i> extending right
across the stream from S.S.W. to N.N.E., gave us
endless trouble.</p>

<p>I warned Alcides to get us alongside some rocks in
order that we might let the canoe down with ropes,
as the rapid, with a sheer drop of over 6 ft., looked too
dangerous for us to shoot it. But Alcides was furious
with the other men, and in order to punish them
steered the canoe into the most dangerous part of the
rapid. A second later the canoe, at an angle of 45&deg;,
was swept away down the foaming current along the
slant of the rapid, which extended there for about 15 m.
The channel was a most intricate one, with rocks
scattered all over it, so that it was absolutely impossible
for the canoe, with her great length, to go through
without having an accident.</p>

<p>As we shaved a big rock in the middle of the rapid,
and I saw the canoe steering straight for another big
rock in front, I knew disaster was imminent, and leapt
out on the rock. So frequently was it necessary for
me to do so, that I had become quite an expert at
jumping, and had acquired almost the agility of a
monkey. Alcides, too, seeing the danger, also tried
to follow my example, but unfortunately missed his
footing and was swept away by the current. I just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-215" id="Pg_2-215"></a>[<a href="images/2-215.png">215</a>]</span>
managed to seize him before he disappeared for good,
and dragged him safely on to the rock.</p>

<p>In the meantime the canoe had swung with great
vigour and struck the big rock sideways, smashing her
side and filling at once with water. All the baggage
was swamped; only a portion of the canoe aft remained
above the water, many of our things being
washed away altogether.</p>

<p>There she stuck, fortunately for us. With considerable
danger we managed to undo the ropes which
were fastened to her stern. After several hours of
hard work&mdash;and of extreme peril for the men who
could not swim, as we had to work all the time with
the water up to our necks in a powerful current, which
made it most difficult to keep our footing&mdash;we succeeded
in pulling her off and taking her alongside the
bank.</p>

<p>That disaster was rather a serious one for us, as
it injured many of my instruments, particularly the
aneroids; but I considered myself fortunate in managing
to save all the photographs and notebooks as well
as the instruments for taking astronomical observations,
which were kept in airtight cases. I lost my favourite
pair of shoes, which were by my side in the canoe when
I jumped out.</p>

<p>As it so frequently happened that we had to jump
into the water&mdash;in fact, we spent more time in the
water than out&mdash;I had adopted as a costume my
pyjamas, under which I always wore the belt with the
heavy packages of money. The paper money&mdash;a very
considerable sum&mdash;had with the many baths become
a solid mass. I could not well spread the banknotes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-216" id="Pg_2-216"></a>[<a href="images/2-216.png">216</a>]</span>
out in the sun to dry, as I did not wish my men to
know how much I possessed; so that for many,
many weeks I had around my waist those heavy
leather wallets soaked in water, my natural heat not
being quite sufficient to dry them.</p>

<p>We had worked in the stream until nearly midnight.
We had nothing to eat when we had finished our work,
and the result was that the next morning my men
were still tired.</p>

<p>Two of my cameras were by my side when the
canoe was swamped, one containing eighteen plates,
the other twelve, all of which had been exposed. The
cameras, being heavy, remained at the bottom of the
canoe and were saved, but the bath did not do them
good. I did not want to lose the plates, so there
was only one course to follow, and that was to develop
them while they were still wet. While my men slept
I sat up a good portion of the night developing all
those plates&mdash;quite successfully too&mdash;and trying to
clean and fix up the cameras again for use the next
day. One of my other cameras had been destroyed
previously by one of my men, who sat on it, and of
course smashed it to pieces. Another camera, which
was still in excellent condition, having been in an air-tight
case, was rather too big to be used for the work
in going down the rapids.</p>

<p>During the night of August 7th the minimum
temperature was 62&deg; F.</p>

<p class="fsc">Conveying the Canoe, weighing 2,000 lb., over a Hill Range&mdash;The Descent.</p>
<hr />
<p>I worked the entire morning with Alcides, trying
to mend the poor canoe. The hole which had been
made in her side was so big that Alcides could insert his
head into it with great ease. It was not until two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-217" id="Pg_2-217"></a>[<a href="images/2-217.png">217</a>]</span>
o'clock in the afternoon that we started once more.
Along the river, which flowed in that particular section
to the south-west, was a hill range on the north-west.
The range rose 300 ft. above the level of the
river. We had gone only some 2,000 m. when we
came to another bad rapid stretching across the river
from south-east to north-west. We were in a hilly
region, hills being visible all along the stream. Soon
afterwards we came to another powerful fall over a
vertical rocky wall extending from north-west to
south-east. Such redoubtable waves were produced
there by the force of the water shooting over and then
rebounding upwards, that we had to use the greatest
care in letting down the unloaded canoe. At one
moment she was more than two-thirds out of the water,
only her stern resting on the top of the fall, the rest
projecting outward in the air for some moments until
she dropped down again.</p>

<p>Since the day we had taken the canoe over the hill
range at the August Falls, I had doubled my men's
salaries&mdash;although their original salaries were already
many times higher than they would receive from
Brazilian employers. I fully recognized that the work
was hard, and I wished to encourage them in every
possible way.</p>

<p>Next, the river went through a narrow gorge, only
80 m. wide, where the current was mighty strong.
High volcanic rocks stood on the right side of us.
When we emerged from the narrow neck, which measured
some 500 m. in length, we found powerful whirlpools.
Farther on the river once more went through a
bad narrow passage, 40 to 60 m. wide, with a succession<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-218" id="Pg_2-218"></a>[<a href="images/2-218.png">218</a>]</span>
of rapids&mdash;extremely unpleasant&mdash;for a length of
600 m.</p>

<p>My men were in great form that day, and we shot
one rapid after another in fine style, Alcides&mdash;for a
change&mdash;being amenable to reason and following my
instructions, which carried us through that dangerous
section without mishap. The stream Uruguatos entered
the Arinos just above the latter rapids.</p>

<p>That day was indeed a trying one for us. Another
narrow channel, 50 m. wide, was reached, along the
250 m. length of which we proceeded with great caution.
Then a big basin spread out before us, where the
current and eddies were terrific. The bottom of the
river was mostly rocky, with great holes and depressions
which caused the water to rotate in all directions. In
some places amidst the foaming waters could be seen
great circles of leaden-looking water, as still as oil.
It was in a similar place in the Niagara whirlpool that
the famous swimmer, Captain Webb, disappeared for
ever. We saw thousands of those places on the Arinos.</p>

<p>The line of the banks on both sides was extremely
rocky. In front of us we had a hill with extensive
campos on its northerly slope. Then we came to the
next rapid. We had endless trouble in this rapid,
followed by a second one, practically a continuation
of the first.</p>

<p>For 1,000 m. the navigation was extremely dangerous.
We unloaded and reloaded the canoe dozens
of times that day, although the work of taking the
baggage over on our heads was not so troublesome
now, as we had very little baggage left. But if we had
not much, it was still the heaviest cases which re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-219" id="Pg_2-219"></a>[<a href="images/2-219.png">219</a>]</span>mained.
All together they weighed between five and
six hundred pounds. The river ran beside a range of
hills on the left side.</p>

<p>When we halted, exhausted, late at night we had
travelled that day the meagre distance of 9,900 m.</p>

<p>My men killed two large spider monkeys, which
supplied them with a meal. I could not touch them,
as the monkeys looked too human for words. It
made me positively ill to see one of my men biting with
great gusto at an arm and hand which had been
roasted on the flames, and which looked exactly like
a portion of a human corpse. The smell, too, of the
roasted monkeys was similar to the odour of roasted
human beings&mdash;which I knew well, as I had on several
previous occasions been at rough cremations of people
in Japan, in the Himahlya (or Himalayas), and in
Africa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> all slept soundly that night, I taking good care to

<p>In the morning my men killed another big monkey,
with the most human face I have ever seen on a quadruman&mdash;just
like a negro's countenance. It came
very near us in its curiosity to see what we were doing,
and, though shot at several times, remained there
watching us, as it had never heard the report of a rifle
before. When it fell down it put its hand on the
wound across its chest and cried just like a child. I
moved away while my men banged it on the head to
finish it off.</p>

<p class="fsc">Author's Canoe being made to travel across the Forest.</p>
<hr />
<p>After a hearty breakfast on the part of my men&mdash;my
own being limited to a small box of sardines, some
twenty or thirty boxes still remaining in my supply of
provisions&mdash;we resumed our journey down the troublesome
rapid. We had to do that with ropes, Alcides,
with his extraordinary way of thinking, actually going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-221" id="Pg_2-221"></a>[<a href="images/2-221.png">221</a>]</span>
to the trouble of shifting a big rock out of the water,
which took him the best part of an hour, rather than
let the canoe go round it&mdash;in absolutely placid waters
in that particular spot. I let him do it rather than
have a quarrel, as I firmly believed that in consequence
of the great hardships his brain had slightly lost its
balance.</p>

<p>After that, strong eddies were again experienced
at first, but, for some 3,000 m. beyond, the water looked
beautiful and as placid as possible. The river was now
flowing mostly in a northerly direction or with slight
deviations, chiefly to the east. We came to a most
wonderful island with a spur of lava on its southern
side, in the shape of a dome, and highly glazed. On
each side of that island was a waterfall of some beauty.
The eastern channel was only 20 m. wide, and the
water fell over a wall of rock some 12 ft. high. Where
this wall projected above the foaming water the shiny
black carbonized rock showed a number of small
grottoes in its horizontal strata, and a number of
funnels like volcanic vents. The north-westerly and
broader channel had three successive rapids, the central
one some 10&frac12; ft. high, with a terrific current rushing
over it, and awe-inspiring whirlpools between the successive
rapids.</p>

<p>We took the canoe down by the central channel,
and when we got to the higher step, shoved her along
until she overhung the fall&mdash;as we had done the previous
day&mdash;and then let her drop down with a bump.
It was a difficult job to hold her when once she had
dropped down, as the waves below were very high and
tossed her about in a merciless manner.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-222" id="Pg_2-222"></a>[<a href="images/2-222.png">222</a>]</span>
My men had by this time become a little more
amenable to reason, and in moments of suspense or
danger always awaited my orders.</p>

<p>Once more did we eventually pack in the canoe
what remained of the baggage; once more did we
start&mdash;that time across a large basin 1,200 m. broad,
with hills on the east side of us on the right bank. On
the right of us, on leaving the basin, we had a beautiful
island, 300 m. long&mdash;Ariadne Island&mdash;with a fine
sand-spit at its southern end, and gorgeous vegetation
upon it. Barring a few boxes of sardines, we had no
more provisions of any kind, as all the food had been
wasted, or lost in our various accidents.</p>

<p>When I look back upon that journey, I am amazed
to think how Providence did help us all along. That
day my men were clamouring for food, and were most
unpleasant, putting the entire blame upon me and not
upon their own lack of common-sense. They refused
to go on. We pulled up along some rocks, baking hot
from the sun, which simply roasted our naked feet
when we trod upon them.</p>

<p>Some of the men took to their rifles and said they
had had quite enough of exploring. The more we went
down that river the worse things seemed to get. They
would not go a metre farther. They claimed the
balance of their salaries at once&mdash;I always paid them
punctually every month&mdash;and said they would start on
foot and try to get somewhere, if God would help them.</p>

<p>I agreed to pay them their salaries and let them
go, taking a few minutes to distribute the money, as
I wished to go to a secluded spot, not caring to undo
the large packages of banknotes before them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-223" id="Pg_2-223"></a>[<a href="images/2-223.png">223</a>]</span>
I was walking along the rocks, saying to my men
that I would be back in a few minutes, when a huge
<i>cachorra</i>, or dog-fish, weighing some thirty pounds,
leapt out of the water and fell on the rocks, wriggling
and bounding convulsively. I called the men, who
hastily arrived, and with the butts of their rifles killed
the fish. While they were busy dissecting it, Alcides,
who had not taken part in the quarrel, but had gone
to the forest some little way off, hearing the noise,
reappeared with a huge monkey he had killed.</p>

<p>I left the men to prepare an excellent and plentiful
meal while I retired to a distant spot to count out
their salaries. When I returned and handed them the
money&mdash;after their appetites had been fully satisfied,
and they had left next to nothing for me&mdash;they said
I could keep the money, as they did not want it;
they were sorry for what they had said, and would go
on wherever I ordered them to go. They said that I
certainly must have a guardian angel watching over
me, and they were sure that as long as they were in
my company they would never die of starvation.</p>

<p>"I have never seen anything like it!" exclaimed
the man X, who was the humorist of the party.
"We want food and cannot get it, and there <i>el senhor</i>
strolls a few yards away from us and a huge fish jumps
almost into his arms in order to be eaten."</p>

<p>I never cared to let them know of my own surprise
at the extraordinary occurrence.</p>

<p>I was rather pleased that day, because my men,
in an outburst of friendliness, said they knew that if
ever we did die of starvation it would not be my fault,
because had they been careful we would still have had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-224" id="Pg_2-224"></a>[<a href="images/2-224.png">224</a>]</span>
three or four months' supply of provisions left. They
themselves said how foolish they had been; the provisions
we carried had only lasted us thirty days.
Nearly three weeks before I had warned Alcides to
economize, and the result was that, instead of sorting
out food twice a day to the men, he sorted it out four
times a day and in double quantities.</p>

<hr />
<p>That day we were really in great luck. We had the
good fortune to find a <i>bacopari</i> tree simply laden with
delicious yellow fruit, not unlike unripe cherries, and
we absolutely feasted on them.</p>

<p>To show how unpractical my men were, it is sufficient
to tell that, unlike any other human beings on the
face of the globe when under a fruit-tree, they did
not proceed to shake the cherries down by throwing
sticks or by climbing up the tree. No, indeed;
but they cut down the huge tree, which required
about an hour and a half of very hard work. Anyhow,
we got the cherries, and that was the principal
thing.</p>

<p>We continued our journey over a small rapid with
a low hill range spreading from west to east on the
left bank. The river here was 300 m. wide. A hill
range from 100 to 200 ft. high was also to be seen on
the right bank, running parallel with that on the left.
Five or six kilometres farther another high range of a
gorgeous cobalt-blue colour and extending from south-west
to north-east, stood in front of us. The river in
that stretch was most beautiful, and was 900 m. wide.
A charming little island 300 m. long was reflected in
the water, which looked as still as oil in that particular
part, although it actually ran swiftly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-225" id="Pg_2-225"></a>[<a href="images/2-225.png">225</a>]</span>
Although that scene was of great placidity, we believed
there was more danger ahead of us, for we could hear
in the distance the loud roar of another rapid or waterfall.
Judging by the noise we knew it must be a big
one. Soon afterwards we reached the rapid.</p>

<p>We had the greatest difficulty in approaching this,
owing to the strong current we encountered in a small
channel we followed near the right bank. The rapid
was 400 m. wide and 400 m. long, with a drop of from
4 to 5 ft. Although we expected trouble at that spot,
we shot the rapid with comparative ease, but we were
badly knocked about, and shipped a considerable
amount of water in the high waves thrown violently
against the rocks. We camped that night near the
rapid, having travelled in the day 26 kil. We made
our camp in the forest, and we experienced stifling
heat, the minimum temperature (August 9th) being
73&deg; F., with heavy rain which came down upon us
through the foliage in regular bucketfuls.</p>

<p>We had nothing to eat in the evening. In the
morning our breakfast consisted of two sardines each.
We went on in a half-hearted way, my men grumbling
all the time, and looking out for birds or monkeys.
Seven thousand five hundred metres from our camp
we came to a waterfall, where we had endless
trouble. The principal channel led to 50&deg; b.m., but
the river split up into innumerable channels among
islands, islets and rocks that formed a regular maze.
The river was in that particular spot 1,200 m. wide,
and contained great masses of volcanic rock, much
fissured, and having great holes in them. This mass
of rock extended from north-east to south-west.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-226" id="Pg_2-226"></a>[<a href="images/2-226.png">226</a>]</span>
There were large cracks, where the mass had split,
and had subsequently been eroded by the rush of
water. The rock had cutting edges everywhere like
those of razors. With endless difficulty we had managed
to drag the canoe along nearly to the bottom of
that dangerous place, when we were suddenly confronted
by a drop of 12 ft. with a terrific rush of
water over it. It was impossible for us to negotiate
that point, for below was a whirlpool absolutely
impassable. We had therefore the tiresome work
of dragging back the canoe for some 350 m. up
the rapid once more, in order that we might find a
more suitable channel. To make things more lively
for us, a violent thunderstorm broke out, soaking all
our baggage but making little difference to us, as we
were soaked already. We had spent that entire day
in the water, struggling to take the canoe down the
rapid and up once more. By eight o'clock at night
we were still working, endeavouring to save the canoe.</p>

<p>We had had no lunch, and now had no dinner. My
men felt perfectly miserable, and in their speech did
not exactly bless the day they had started with me
on that expedition. We had worked hard, and had
only covered a distance of 7,500 m. in twelve hours.
At sunset, while the storm was raging, we beheld a
most wonderful effect of light to the west, very
much like a gorgeous aurora borealis. The sky, of
intense vermilion, was streaked with beautiful radiations
of the brightest lemon-yellow, which showed out
vividly against the heavy black clouds directly above
our heads. The river reflected the red tints, so that
we appeared to be working in a river of blood.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-227" id="Pg_2-227"></a>[<a href="images/2-227.png">227</a>]</span>
As we had nothing to eat, I thought I would spend
my time in taking the correct elevation of that place
with the boiling-point thermometers. The man X,
the humorist of the party, remarked that if I were
killed and went to Heaven or some other place, the
first thing I should do would be to take the exact
elevation with what he called "the little boiling
stove" (the hypsometrical apparatus).</p>

<p>We had a minimum temperature of 62&deg; F. during
the night of August 10th.</p>

<p>Next morning I sent my men to reconnoitre, in order
to see if they could get some edible fruit. As they
stayed away a long time I knew they had found something.
In fact, they came back quite in a good humour,
as they had found some <i>jacoba</i> or <i>jacuba</i> trees, with
abundant fruit on them, most delicious to eat.</p>

<p>In the meantime I had gone exploring the rapids endeavouring
to find a more suitable channel. Eventually,
on the east side of the stream, I found a place where
we could take the canoe down. There too was a
fall of 9 ft., down which we let the canoe with
considerable difficulty; then it had to pass over a
number of smaller terraces and down winding channels,
where we sweated for some hours before we got
through our work. Innumerable channels separated by
sand-mounds 20 to 30 ft. high had formed along that
rapid and also through the vertical wall of cutting
volcanic rock which formed a barrier across the stream.
Below the fall were two long sand-banks, one with
some <i>burity</i> palms upon it.</p>

<p>The river flowed 20&deg; west of north for some 4,000 m.
We had gone but 2,000 m. of that distance when we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-228" id="Pg_2-228"></a>[<a href="images/2-228.png">228</a>]</span>
came to another rocky barrier, spreading from south-west
to north-east, on approaching which we heard the
thundering roaring of another rapid. On the left bank
we had a hill range all along. The noise of the rapid
got louder and louder, and we were soon confronted
by a terrifying rush of water at a spot where three
arms of the river met with such force that the
clashing waters shot up in the air, forming a wave
some 40 or 50 ft. high with a foaming crest. The
backwash from this great wave was so violent against
the rocky banks of the river&mdash;very narrow there&mdash;that
it was quite impossible for the canoe, even empty, to
be let down by means of ropes.</p>

<p>My men were in absolute despair, for the farther
we went the more insurmountable became the obstacles
which confronted us. They said they had agreed to
go on a journey of exploration, but surely I was taking
them direct to Hades&mdash;if we had not got there already.
I could not well contradict them, for certainly that
particular spot was the nearest possible approach to it.</p>

<p>It does not do ever to lose courage. While my men,
in the lowest state of depression, sat on the volcanic
rocks, I went about exploring on the right bank until
I found a place where the river had eroded a channel
but had afterwards filled it with an immense accumulation
of rocks. If we could only move those rocks away&mdash;several
hundreds of them&mdash;I saw that it would
be possible to push the canoe along the channel which
would thus be formed. The work would require a
great deal of hard labour.</p>

<p class="fsc">A Most Dangerous Rapid navigated by Author and his Men.</p>
<hr />
<p>You should have seen the faces of my men when I
took them to the spot and asked them to remove all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-229" id="Pg_2-229"></a>[<a href="images/2-229.png">229</a>]</span>
the big boulders. In order to set them a good example,
I myself started moving the rocks about, the smaller
ones for preference. We worked and worked hour
after hour, jamming our fingers and feet all the
time as we pushed the rocks to one side and the
other of the little channel, only 4 ft. wide, which we
were making. The language of my men was pretty
enough, but as long as they worked I had to put up
with it. Alcides, who was really a great worker, and
whose principal fault was that he would never save
himself, worked with tremendous vigour that day. Somehow
or other the men seemed to think the work hard.</p>

<p>When we had taken the canoe safely to the end of
the rapid through the channel we had cleared, I went
back to the top of the rapid to gaze once more on the
wonderful sight where the two principal channels met.
The water dashed against a rock in the centre with
most impressive fury.</p>

<p>On returning to the bottom of the rapid where I
had left the canoe, another most impressive sight was
to be seen. In the vertiginous waters emerging from
the channel high waves&mdash;most unpleasant-looking and
in the greatest confusion&mdash;clashed against one another
for a distance of over 500 m. below the rapid.</p>

<p>My men would not camp that night near the rapid,
which they said was the devil's home, so during the
night we went 2 kil. down the stream, where, simply
worn out, we made our camp. We never could get
any fish from the stream now. We had gone only
6,000 m. that day. I reckoned that, travelling at
that rate, I should perhaps reach my goal, Manaos, in
five or six years' time&mdash;and all the provisions I had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-230" id="Pg_2-230"></a>[<a href="images/2-230.png">230</a>]</span>
left for seven men, all counted, were now eight tins of
sardines.</p>

<p>We had a minimum temperature of 64&deg; F. on the
night of August 11th.</p>

<p>We had halted just above another big and beautiful
waterfall, 20 ft. high, and of immense width.
The great rush of water curled over a gigantic dome
of volcanic rock with many big holes and fissures.
The waterfall was followed by a ghastly rapid 500 m.
long. It was impossible to go over the fall, and the
only way left us&mdash;a most dangerous one&mdash;was to let the
canoe down a small channel 50 to 80 m. wide, cut
among the vertical rocks on the right side of the waterfall.
The water in the channel flowed in steeply sloping
cascades. The channel twisted round abruptly in
two or three places, and in one spot went through a
rocky neck 35 m. wide, where the force of the current
was so great that I was really perplexed as to how
we could take the canoe down without getting her
smashed to atoms.</p>

<p>Providence came to my help again. In looking
round I discovered an ancient channel, now almost
dry and strewn with innumerable rocks, by which it
might be possible to take the canoe overland until we
could find a smooth place in the water below the rapid.
On further exploring that channel, as I was quick
enough in noticing its possibilities, I found at the end
of it what the Brazilians call a <i>recanto</i>&mdash;that is to say,
a backwater which the river had there formed, and
which would be a great help to us in floating the canoe
once more.</p>

<p>This plan involved a great deal of hard work, as not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-231" id="Pg_2-231"></a>[<a href="images/2-231.png">231</a>]</span>
only had we to shift many large rocks out of their
position, but we had to construct a railway with felled
trees and rollers upon them. We could not get perfectly
horizontal rails, so that the effort of moving the
canoe along inch by inch with levers was trying,
especially as we had had insufficient food for many
days and our strength was fast failing.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, Alcides that day broke out
in revolt. He had, like many ignorant people, the misfortune
of believing that he knew everything better than
anybody else. I had given him instructions to place the
rails and rollers in a certain position, so that the canoe
could be shifted over some unpleasant rocks. He, however,
insisted on placing the rollers in the wrong place
and on using the levers in the wrong spots, so that
they not only did not act helpfully, but actually had
the contrary effect on the canoe from that which we
wanted to obtain. I remonstrated, and showed the
men once more how to do it. They agreed with me,
except Alcides, who became enraged to such an extent
that his eyes bulged out of their orbits in his fury.
He brandished one of the big levers in the air, and,
shouting at the top of his voice, proceeded to give a
long harangue stating that Araguary&mdash;his native town&mdash;produced
greater men than England or any other
country, and inciting the other men to open revolt
against me.</p>

<p>This was a serious affair and most unexpected, as
so far I had counted on Alcides to stand by me, no
matter what happened. The other men were undecided.
Although they were always ready to revolt,
they had more confidence in the brain of an English<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-232" id="Pg_2-232"></a>[<a href="images/2-232.png">232</a>]</span>man
than in that of an Araguary man. Alcides suggested
that they should take possession of the canoe
and everything, and that I should be left on the rocks.
He shouted to the men to take the canoe along, and
he himself pushed with all his might, the canoe not
budging the tenth part of an inch.</p>

<p>I sat down on a rock. I merely said that the canoe
would not move until I wished it to move. This
statement I made because I saw that in their stupidity
they had placed some pieces of wood under the canoe
which acted as wedges instead of rollers; one piece in
particular&mdash;a roller which had split in two&mdash;could not
possibly move along the rough wooden rails. The
men pushed and worked with all their might for over
three hours, the canoe remaining still like a solid rock.
At last they came to me and asked me to show them
how to move it. I placed the rollers where they would
be effective, removing the wedges which were impeding
her journey, and with very little effort the canoe moved
along.</p>

<p>With wild yells of excitement the men proclaimed
this a miracle, always excepting Alcides, who, with a
fierce expression on his face, stood now on one side,
fondling his rifle. The other men chaffed him, and
even insulted him, saying that he had made them
struggle for nothing, as he did not know what he was
about. When the rails and the rollers were placed
right the canoe slid along the distance which remained
to be covered, and eventually glided gracefully once
more into the water.</p>

<p class="fsc">Letting the Canoe jump a Rapid.</p>
<hr />
<p>It was too bad that Alcides&mdash;one of the bravest of
men&mdash;should possess such a mean mind and such an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-233" id="Pg_2-233"></a>[<a href="images/2-233.png">233</a>]</span>
ungrateful nature. Twice I had saved his life when he
came within an ace of perishing in dangerous rapids,
but never had he given thanks to me&mdash;never had he
shown the slightest sign of recognition. Never, during
the entire time he was in my employ, did he&mdash;or
any of my other men&mdash;say "Good morning" to me
when we rose, or "Good night" when we retired to
sleep. Two or three nights before this last adventure,
during a heavy rainstorm, I had deprived myself
of my own tent in order to shelter him and the other
men, while I myself got drenched.</p>

<p>"He only does it," said he, "because he needs to
keep us alive to do the work, or else he would not
do it."</p>

<p>I only received offensive words for any kindnesses
I showered on him and the others.</p>

<p>It is seldom one could find a man with a more unpractical
mind. He spent most of his energy working
uselessly&mdash;and, mind you, very hard indeed&mdash;for nothing,
but he could never be made to apply his strength
in a sensible way. If I asked him to cut me a tooth-pick,
he would proceed to cut down one of the largest
trees in the neighbourhood and work for an hour or
two until he had reduced a big section of it into the
needed article. He wasted hours daily, and ruined all
our axes and cutlery into the bargain, in scraping flat
surfaces on rocks and on the hardest trees, on which he
subsequently engraved his name and that of his lady-love
whom he had left behind. He was really marvellous
at calligraphy, and could certainly write the
best hand of any man I have ever known.</p>

<p>He quarrelled all the time with all the other men,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-234" id="Pg_2-234"></a>[<a href="images/2-234.png">234</a>]</span>
and to enforce his words was constantly producing his
automatic pistol fully loaded or else his rifle.</p>

<p>When I first employed him I had the misfortune to
send him on some messages to two or three people,
with the result that those former friends became my
bitterest enemies, as he had insulted them. He
was one of the men who cannot open their mouths
without offending. Wasteful to an incredible degree,
his only ambition was to show how much he could
spend&mdash;especially when he was spending other people's
money&mdash;a most trying thing for me when we were,
months before, near any shop. When you mentioned
anything to him he immediately said that it
was impossible to do it, no matter how simple the
matter was. He spent hours looking at himself in a
small pocket mirror he carried on his person, and
would grumble for long hours over the stings of
mosquitoes and gnats which had dared to spoil his
features. He used violent language against the impudent
rocks which had injured his feet.</p>

<p>His brutality to men and beasts alike was most
hurtful to me. He once abandoned his favourite dog
on an island, simply because he had kicked it viciously
the day before and the dog would not respond to his
calls and enter the canoe. He now proposed to kill
the other dogs, as he said they had finished their work
as watch-dogs, since we never came across any Indians,
and it was no use taking them along.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brazilians</span> of a low class are unfortunately easily led
by words. Alcides, who could not get over his bad
temper, once more incited the men to revolt. While
I was busy taking altitude observations with the
hypsometrical apparatus I kept my eye on them, as I
saw plainly that I was coming in for trouble.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for us another bad part of the rapid
had to be negotiated, and the only way possible was
to take the canoe overland once more. With Alcides
at their head, all the men were now in open rebellion,
and absolutely refused to work.</p>

<p>"Very good," I said to them. "If you do not like
to take the canoe along we shall stay here. I like this
spot very much, as it is most picturesque."</p>

<p>The men filled the magazines of their rifles with
cartridges, and then came threateningly toward me,
shoving the muzzles right in my face.</p>

<p>"You must give us food," said they. "We want
to eat, and we want to be taken back to our country."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-236" id="Pg_2-236"></a>[<a href="images/2-236.png">236</a>]</span>
I advised them to take a walk in the forest
and see if they could shoot something there, for
if they shot me, one fact was certain, and that
was that they would never see their happy homes
again.</p>

<p>Two of the men turned away in order to go after
game, but the man X levelled his rifle at my head
and demanded his money, as he wished to leave at
once. The contract I had with him was different from
that I had with the other men. I had agreed to pay
him on reaching the nearest point of civilization,
where I would let him loose again. I therefore said
that I would most certainly pay him the very minute
he had fulfilled his contract.</p>

<p>I paid no more attention to his threat, although I
heard the click of the hammer of his rifle being cocked.
I told him to get some wood to make a fire, as I wished
to make myself a cup of chocolate.</p>

<p>In unpacking some of my instruments I had made a
great discovery&mdash;a box of chocolate, which had strayed
into a package by mistake.</p>

<p>X seemed undecided whether to shoot or not. I
made no attempt to take the rifle out of his hand, as
that would have been fatal. After a few moments he
sat down on a rock a few yards away, his rifle resting
on his knees and pointing in my direction, while I
myself collected some small pieces of wood and proceeded
to make the fire.</p>

<p class="fsc">Artificial Canal made by Author and his Men in order to take their Canoe along where the river was Impassable.</p>
<hr />
<p>Filippe the negro, who had his eye on the box of
chocolate, came and helped to blow the flame. We got
some water and boiled it in a large tin cup. While we
were doing that I heard rifles being fired in the forest,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-237" id="Pg_2-237"></a>[<a href="images/2-237.png">237</a>]</span>
and presently Antonio returned with some fine <i>jacu</i>
(<i>Penelope cristata</i>) he had shot.</p>

<p>The entire morning of August 12th was absolutely
wasted, owing to the conduct of my men. Even after
they had had a good meal, not a particle of which they
offered me&mdash;not that I asked them for it&mdash;they were
still in a riotous mood.</p>

<p>As was my habit when I had anything to eat, I
always shared it in equal parts with them: when the
chocolate was ready&mdash;notwithstanding their behaviour&mdash;I
asked them for their cups, and each one received
his share of that delicious beverage. As usual also, I
sorted out that day the customary allowance of tobacco
to each man, which I had been fortunate enough to
save in our accidents.</p>

<p>When I offered the chocolate to Alcides, he handed
his cup to Filippe to bring to me, and when it was
handed back to him he flung it away saying he would
prefer to die rather than drink the filthy English stuff.</p>

<p>Matters were a little critical. A great number of
rollers were required and a number of wooden rails.
Curiously enough, the man X, who had been the most
violent that day, was the only one who came to thank
me for the chocolate, and offered to work, the others
all refusing to move.</p>

<p>He and I cut down three or four trees, when the
other men&mdash;ashamed of themselves&mdash;took the axes
and proceeded to work also. But instead of cutting
down trees which were straight they cut down the
knottiest trees they could find, and made rollers which
were absolutely useless. It was their silly way of wasting
the little energy they had left. The result was that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-238" id="Pg_2-238"></a>[<a href="images/2-238.png">238</a>]</span>
they had to do the work over again and cut other trees
and other rollers.</p>

<p>Eventually we succeeded in pushing the canoe over
the rocks until we were some 20 m. from the water
again. With some effort we succeeded in shoving her
along 18 m. out of those 20 m. There only remained
the last 2 m.&mdash;unfortunately uphill, which made our
effort a little greater. Here the men again stopped
work and refused to give that last push to get the
canoe over those rocks and then into the water. Once
more they said they would shoot me and then proceed
through the forest on foot.</p>

<p>Matters looked bad indeed. Those 2 m., with a
sharp angle upward, made an insurmountable obstacle
which I could not negotiate alone. With the corner
of my eye I saw the rifles of my men levelled at me.
There was only one way out of that difficulty&mdash;to give
my men a little excitement.</p>

<p>"Very good!" I said to them. "If we have not
the strength to move the canoe over those rocks, we
certainly have the courage to shoot the rapid." I said
I had never yet known a Brazilian who failed when it
came to courage, and I was sure they would not fail,
as I had already seen how brave they had been.</p>

<p>Flattery always answers.</p>

<p>"Come along, boys! We will take the canoe back
into the rapid."</p>

<p>In a moment they had deposited their rifles on the
rocks and they were all helping me to push the canoe
back the way we had come.</p>

<p>The rapid in that particular part was devilish&mdash;not
unlike the narrow channel we had gone through some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-239" id="Pg_2-239"></a>[<a href="images/2-239.png">239</a>]</span>
time before. The passage, with high rocks on either
side, was tortuous, and threw the water with great force
from one side to the other, producing high waves in
the centre in such confusion that it was quite terrifying
to look at them.</p>

<p>When my men looked at those awful waters, they
suggested that perhaps we had better let the canoe
down with ropes. I had quite made up my mind that
we should lose the canoe for certain in that spot; and
had we gone down in her ourselves we should undoubtedly
have lost our lives as well.</p>

<p>When we started taking her down with ropes&mdash;our
ropes were all rotted by that time, and had no strength
whatever&mdash;the canoe was tossed about in a merciless
manner. I recommended my men as they ran along
to beware of the ropes catching on the cutting edges
of the high rocks. No sooner had the canoe started
down the swift current than one of the ropes at
once caught on a rock and snapped. The men who
held the other rope were unable to hold it, and let it
go. I saw the canoe give three or four leaps in the
centre of the channel and then disappear altogether.
That was a sad moment for me. But as my eye
roamed along the foaming waters, what was my surprise
when I saw the canoe shoot out of the water in
a vertical position at the end of the rapid and waterfall!
That was the greatest piece of luck I had on
that journey. By being flung out of the water with
such force she naturally emptied herself of all the
water she contained, and I next saw her floating, going
round and round the whirlpool at the bottom of the
rapid.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-240" id="Pg_2-240"></a>[<a href="images/2-240.png">240</a>]</span>
The next problem was how to recover the canoe,
as she happened to be on the opposite side of the
stream. There for more than two hours we watched
her going round and round, while we sat on the rocks,
absolutely speechless. Eventually we saw her gradually
come out of the whirlpool and drift slowly in the
<i>recanto</i> or backwater on the opposite shore some 400 m.
away, revolving slowly around herself.</p>

<p>My men were perplexed. They now said they
would all leave me at once and proceed on foot. Under
no circumstances whatever would they accompany me
any more. They must have their pay and go.</p>

<p>So after a few minutes I paid the salaries of all
the men, excepting the man X. To my surprise the
men, instead of going, remained seated a little way
off.</p>

<p>I had a plan in my head of swimming across the
river below the whirlpool, where the water was placid
although of great width, but I could not very well
place myself in such an awkward position as to leave
on the river bank the large sums of money which I
carried on my person. I certainly could not swim across
such a long distance, and in such a current, with the
heavy bags of coin and banknotes round my waist. I
feared&mdash;in fact, felt certain&mdash;that in the mood in which
my men were that day, the moment I entered the
water and was quite helpless they would fire at me
and get away with everything I possessed. I knew
that they would never dare to do it unless they could
catch me in a helpless condition.</p>

<p class="fsc">Rapid through which Author took his Canoe.</p>
<hr />
<p>I called Antonio&mdash;who was an excellent swimmer&mdash;and
said that I offered a reward of &pound;10 to any men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-241" id="Pg_2-241"></a>[<a href="images/2-241.png">241</a>]</span>
who swam across and recovered the canoe. Antonio
reflected deeply for some time, then consented to go
if another man went with him. For nearly an hour
he confabulated with Filippe the white man, who was
also a splendid swimmer. It was with some relief that
I saw the two eventually enter the water, after a
paddle had been tied with long strings round each of
their waists in order that they might be able to bring
the canoe back.</p>

<p>At the point where they started the river was
200 m. wide. Although seemingly placid the current
was strong. They drifted down some 300 m.&mdash;I with
my telescope keeping a sharp watch on the canoe,
which was still going round and round, and was now
once more almost entirely filled with water. No sooner
had the men, quite exhausted, reached the opposite
bank than the canoe, which had been in that spot for
some hours, for some reason or other started out and
proceeded to float down stream in the very centre of
the river. Filippe the negro and I at once started on
a chase on our side of the water, in case she came near
enough to seize her. I shouted and signalled to the
men on the opposite bank to swim across once more to
try and catch her in mid-stream.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, after a chase of several
kilometres, over cutting rocks and great banks of sand
in which we sank up to our knees&mdash;while the naked
men with their paddles ran as fast as they could on
the opposite bank&mdash;the canoe drifted close to the other
bank once more, and the men were able to board her.
It was a great relief to me when at last the canoe was
brought over to our side and we towed her back so as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-242" id="Pg_2-242"></a>[<a href="images/2-242.png">242</a>]</span>
to get the baggage on board and proceed on our
journey.</p>

<p>Each of the two men who had rescued the canoe at
once received the reward I had offered, and Filippe the
negro, who had shown willingness in recovering the
boat, also received a handsome present.</p>

<p>The entire day of August 12th had been spent in
going those few hundred metres of the rapid. Our
camp that evening was but 400 m. from that of the
day before.</p>

<p>The minimum temperature of August 12th had been
70&deg; F., whereas during the night of August 13th it
was 62&deg; F.</p>

<p>That little adventure had pulled the men together
somewhat. I spoke in great praise of the courage that
Antonio and Filippe had shown in swimming across the
stream.</p>

<p>The river was smooth for a little distance, when
we proceeded once more with our navigation; but
soon it became narrow&mdash;only 40 to 50 m. wide&mdash;with
strong eddies in its deep channel between rocky sides.
Some magnificent sand beaches 15 to 20 ft. high were
observed, particularly on the right bank, not far from
a tributary 3 m. wide which entered the main river
on the left side. Lower down, the river described a
sharp turn, and there we met another most dangerous
rapid. It was entered by a passage 50 m. wide, after
which a circular basin of rock&mdash;evidently an ancient
crater&mdash;100 m. in diameter appeared; then the water
flowed out with terrific force by a channel only 30 m.
wide. The stream produced prodigious eddies in the
circular basin. Waves of great height were dashed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-243" id="Pg_2-243"></a>[<a href="images/2-243.png">243</a>]</span>
to and fro from one side to the other of the narrow
channel, between high rocks on either side. The
water flowed first in a direction E.S.E. for 500 m.,
then turned off suddenly to due east for a distance
of 400 m. That spot was most difficult for us to go
through.</p>

<p>Soon after, the river turned due north and broadened
to a width of 120 m. for some 4,000 m. A great basin
was crossed, with submerged rocks, forming counter
currents of great power and most unpleasant whirlpools.
I observed with some concern a stupendous vortex
30 m. in diameter and with a deep central depression.
The water revolved with such velocity and force that
it formed a series of high-crested white waves running
one after another at a terrifying speed around its
periphery. The water was raised around the vortex
certainly 10 or 12 ft. above the level of the river&mdash;owing
to the opposition between the rotating water
and the current. We gave that vortex as wide a berth
as we could; it really frightened one to be near it,
although there was no particular danger unless we
got right into it.</p>

<p>A charming island was passed soon after, on which,
as well as on the left bank, were innumerable rubber
trees, but there were none on the right, where <i>chapada</i>
was to be seen.</p>

<p>We had in front of us a hill range 300 ft. high.
As we went farther we were in a channel between high
rocks strewn about along both banks in fragments of
great size; then we were once again in a circular
basin with high vertical rocks&mdash;perhaps another extinct
crater. We were here in a region of volcanic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-244" id="Pg_2-244"></a>[<a href="images/2-244.png">244</a>]</span>
formation. No sooner had we passed this basin than
we came upon another bad rapid, 400 m. long, which
divided itself into two channels, after going through a
narrow passage not more than 30 m. wide, where we got
tossed about in a most alarming manner, being once or
twice nearly dashed to pieces against the rocky sides.
We had had so much trouble with the rapids that
day that by sunset we had only gone 19 kil. 600 m.
Since we had come to that volcanic region we had
found rocks with great holes in which stagnant water
lay. Myriads of insects&mdash;regular clouds of them&mdash;worried
us nearly to death.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill2-244.jpg"><img src="images/ill2-244_th.jpg" alt="Conveying the Canoe by Hand down a Rapid." title="Conveying the Canoe by Hand down a Rapid." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Conveying the Canoe by Hand down a Rapid.</p>
<hr />
<p>On August 14th we started early, the minimum
temperature having been 70&deg; F. during the night. After
leaving the rapid we came to a great basin 1,000 m.
across. A most beautiful sand beach 300 m. long was
to be seen on the left side, below a vertical cliff of great
beauty, 200 ft. high. Another great sand beach was
to be seen on the right of the river, where it described
a sharp turn to 30&deg; b.m. Then the river dashed
through a passage of rocks only 80 m. broad, and
emerged once more into another great basin with
many indentations in its rocky coast.</p>

<p>Some 6 kil. beyond, another basin was found, with
more rocks strewn on and near its eastern bank, and
a number of rocky islets. A high hill range with
vertical cliffs stood on the west side and ended abruptly
at the end of the basin. Low hills ran all along the
river on the left side.</p>

<p>The river had an average width here of 250 m.,
and flowed mostly in directions between north-west
and north-east.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-245" id="Pg_2-245"></a>[<a href="images/2-245.png">245</a>]</span>
We went down all the time on troubled waters, with
rocky banks and innumerable obstacles all the way.
We went through another terrible and most intricate
rapid&mdash;the Labyrinth&mdash;and passed through a channel
only 40 m. wide between high rocky banks. Then, after
that, for 9,500 m. we had fair and smooth navigation,
with a range of flat-topped hills 300 ft. high, extending
from W.S.W. to E.N.E., in front of us to the north-west.
Here there was a regular maze of channels, all
more or less bad. We did not follow the principal
one, which was strewn with rocks, but a smaller one, at
the end of which, unfortunately, we found a barrier
of rocks which we could not surmount. We had
all the trouble of dragging the canoe back up the
rapid until we could turn her round into another
channel.</p>

<p>We arrived at the waterfall of S. Sim&atilde;o, where we
went through numerous channels, following the right
bank as much as we could, until we arrived at a gigantic
staircase of rock, down which the water divided itself
into little channels. We took all the baggage over the
rocks on the right bank&mdash;a very heavy task, as we had
to climb up and down big boulders with sharp edges.
We slipped many times with the loads we were carrying,
and many, indeed, were the patches of skin we
left behind in that particular place. We had a great
deal of trouble in finding a place where we could take
the canoe down. Eventually we had to go right across
the stream over the waterfall and land on an island of
rock in the centre of the river, where I had seen with
my telescope that we might perhaps find a suitable
passage for the canoe.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-246" id="Pg_2-246"></a>[<a href="images/2-246.png">246</a>]</span>
Crossing the river diagonally just above the fall
was risky work, and although we described a big arc
up the stream, we only just managed to make the
island before we were borne down by the current.</p>

<p>The horseshoe-shaped waterfall was about 300 m.
across and some 30 ft. high. When the river is full it
must be beautiful, for the east side, which was then
absolutely dry, is covered entirely by water, which
must form a wonderful series of cascades. When the
river is in flood, the waterfall, extending from north-west
to south-east, has a total width of 1,000 m.
There were some picturesque bits of rugged foliated
rock over that great staircase, and huge cracks through
which the water gurgled and foamed&mdash;those fissures
formed not by the erosion of water but by volcanic
action, perhaps by an earthquake. The large fall to
the north-west, over which the water flows in every
season, had on one side of it a steep incline, down
which we took the canoe until we came to a drop about
15 ft. high.</p>

<p>We halted for the night just above that high drop,
spending a most miserable night, being simply devoured
by insects. The minimum temperature during
the night of August 15th was 72&deg; F.</p>

<p>My men were in a beastly temper in the morning,
when we had to proceed, as on previous occasions, to
make an artificial channel by moving innumerable
boulders of all sizes. It was a heavy task, for we
hardly had any strength left, our meals having been
most irregular of late.</p>

<p>A channel was not so easily made in that particular
spot, as there were some boulders which we could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-247" id="Pg_2-247"></a>[<a href="images/2-247.png">247</a>]</span>
possibly move, and the canoe must be made to go
over them.</p>

<p>We had only been working for a few minutes, when
again there was a riot among my men; again they
took to their rifles and said they would leave me and
the canoe there. Worse luck, the canoe got stuck hard
on a rock, and the men could not move her. I cut
down some rollers and some levers of the hardest woods
I could find in the forest near there, and when once I
had set to work a little more intelligently than they
did, I had no difficulty in moving the canoe along.
Eventually, with my men swearing at me the whole
time, the canoe was safely at the foot of the waterfall.</p>

<p>We were in great luck that day, for we found plenty
of wild fruit&mdash;very nutritious&mdash;and we killed one or
two large birds. My men grumbled all the time, saying
that they were dying of starvation, no meal being a
meal at all in Brazil unless accompanied by a small
mountain of <i>feij&atilde;o</i> (black beans). I had a few boxes
of sardines left, but I reserved those for extreme
occasions which might yet come.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the fall was an immense basin,
1,200 m. wide and 3,000 m. long from north to south.
The temperature was stifling that day&mdash;96&deg; F. in the
shade, and the sky overladen with clouds.</p>

<p>Fourteen kilometres by river below the S. Sim&atilde;o
came another waterfall, that of All Saints.</p>

<p>Observations with the hypsometrical apparatus
gave an elevation of 772 ft. above the level of the sea.</p>

<p>We halted above the rapid on a beautiful beach.
A curious thing happened. Antonio in jumping into
the water out of the canoe felt something sharp under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-248" id="Pg_2-248"></a>[<a href="images/2-248.png">248</a>]</span>
his foot. In looking down he saw a magnificent sword.
On taking it out of the water we found that it was
an old sword of the time of the Emperor Pedro II.
A fight must have taken place there between a
Brazilian expedition and the Mundurucu Indians, who
at that time were to be found, I believe, in that region.
Presumably the expedition had been attacked at that
spot while trying to land. The sword was in excellent
preservation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> had a minimum temperature on the night of
August 15th of 70&deg; F.</p>

<p>We descended the All Saints rapid and fall, 150 m.
in length, with no great difficulty, although with a
certain amount of hard work.</p>

<p>A large basin was below it, in the eastern part of
which was a charming island. Innumerable rubber
trees (<i>Siphonia elastica</i>) were to be seen in that region.
We found the south-east passage the best in descending
that rapid; but, although comparatively easy, we
had to use the greatest care, as my canoe was by now
falling to pieces, and a hard knock against a rock
would be fatal.</p>

<p>At the eastern end of the basin was a narrow
channel between high rocks, where the current was extremely
strong. A cluster of high vertical columnar
rocks was seen. The three channels into which the
river had been divided joined again in that basin, and
were forced through a passage between high vertical
rocky walls not more than 35 m. apart.</p>

<p>The water naturally was much troubled in being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-250" id="Pg_2-250"></a>[<a href="images/2-250.png">250</a>]</span>
forced from different sides through that narrow passage,
and I knew that there must be danger. We
pulled up the canoe along some rocks 50 or 60 m. from
the entrance of the channel, and I instructed two men
to land and go and explore, to see what was in the
channel. The top rocks in that particular spot formed
innumerable little points, quite sharp, and it was
painful to walk on them with bare feet.</p>

<p>Antonio and white Filippe, who had been instructed
to go and reconnoitre, went a short distance away,
where they sat themselves down behind some rocks,
comfortably smoking cigarettes. After twenty minutes
or so they returned and said they had gone all along
the channel, and there was absolutely smooth water
and no danger whatever. I was not well satisfied with
their answer, but they swore they had inspected the
channel thoroughly, and there was no danger. So I
ordered them to enter the boat once more, and we
started off.</p>

<p>No sooner had we turned the corner round the high
rocky cliffs and entered the narrow gorge than we
were confronted by a huge central wave some 40 ft.
high in the channel. It was formed by the clashing
waters, coming from three different directions, meeting
at that spot and trying to push through simultaneously.
Before we knew where we were the canoe actually flew
up in the air, in an almost vertical position, to the top
of that enormous wave.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill2-250.jpg"><img src="images/ill2-250_th.jpg" alt="A Moment of Suspense." title="A Moment of Suspense." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">A Moment of Suspense.</p>
<p class="figcenter">Author and his men in their canoe going through a narrow channel between vertical walls of rock. The water forced through from three large arms of the river joining at that point formed a high and dangerous central wave.</p>
<hr />
<p>Baggage, men, and dogs slid down in confusion,
the canoe gliding back into the water and progressing
as swift as an arrow down the channel. The next
moment we were on the point of being dashed against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-251" id="Pg_2-251"></a>[<a href="images/2-251.png">251</a>]</span>
the high rocky cliff on our right. To my amazement,
and just as I was expecting the impact, the canoe only
gracefully shaved the rock, the backwash which took
place along the rocks shifting us once more toward the
middle of the stream.</p>

<p>Once again the great rush of water shot us up in
the air, above the central wave, and this time the
canoe bucked and rode down on the other side of that
foaming mass of water.</p>

<p>My men were terrified. "Rema! rema! (Row!
row!) for Heaven's sake!" I shouted to the perplexed
men, as I tried to instil into them a little courage,
when within me I really thought we were lost. As I
shouted those words I saw to my horror two of the
paddles washed away, and as I quickly measured with
my eye the length of the channel I perceived that we still
had some 200 m. more of that kind of navigation before
we should shoot out of that dangerous place.</p>

<p>Up and down we went several times on that high
central wave; several times did we again shave the
rocks on either side of the narrow channel. We were
quite helpless, my men in chorus yelling "We are
lost! we are lost!"</p>

<p>Alcides bravely stuck to the helm for some time,
but the force of the water was so great that he was
knocked down into the canoe and had to let go. When
we reached the point where the narrow passage came
to an end, the waters looked so diabolical that when
my men shouted "We are lost! we are lost!" I could
not help saying "Yes, we are!"</p>

<p>I held on to the canoe desperately, as we were
banged about for a few seconds in a way that nearly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-252" id="Pg_2-252"></a>[<a href="images/2-252.png">252</a>]</span>
stunned us, the waves striking me in the face with such
force that it took me some moments to recover. When
I did I found that we were already out of the channel
and in the whirlpool, the canoe full of water but
fortunately saved.</p>

<p>I lose most things in the world, but I never lose
my patience nor my sense of humour. I could not
help laughing when I looked at the expression on the
faces of my dogs&mdash;an expression of terror and astonishment,
as they looked first at the place from which we
had emerged and then at me, which I am sure would
have meant in words: "Good gracious! where in the
world are you taking us?"</p>

<p>We had to halt as soon as convenient in order to
cut some new paddles. It took my men some hours
to recover from the effects of that experience.</p>

<p>As is generally the case after a violent emotion, a
great deal of merriment was produced, my men for the
rest of the day talking about the incident and reproducing
in a realistic way the sounds of the rushing
water and the impact of the waves against the canoe.</p>

<p>We found after that a great basin 3,000 m. long,
1,300 m. broad, from west to east, with a lovely sand
beach 1,000 m. long on its eastern side.</p>

<p class="fsc">Conveying the Canoe through the Forest.</p>
<p class="figcenter">(Notice the side of the canoe split and stuffed with pieces of cloth.)</p>
<hr />
<p>At last&mdash;after all that time without meeting a soul&mdash;I
came across a small tribe of Mundurucus&mdash;six of
them all counted. They had their <i>aldeja</i>, or village,
on the right side of the stream. Their chief rejoiced
in the name of Jo&atilde;o. They were tiny little fellows,
the tallest only 5 ft. in height. If you had met them
anywhere else than in Central Brazil you would have
mistaken them for Japanese, so exactly like them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-253" id="Pg_2-253"></a>[<a href="images/2-253.png">253</a>]</span>
were they in appearance. Their faces were of a very
dark yellow, almost black, with perfectly straight hair,
just like the Japanese or their near cousins, the Tagalos
of the Philippine Islands.</p>

<p>The Mundurucus were mild and gentle, soft-spoken
and shy. They had all adopted Brazilian clothes.
The hut of the chief was extremely clean and neat
inside, the few utensils that were visible being kept in
a tidy manner.</p>

<p>Jo&atilde;o spoke a little Portuguese. From him I was
able to buy a quantity of <i>farinha</i>, which came in useful
to us, although I had to pay an exorbitant price for it&mdash;&pound;4
sterling for each 50 litres or thereabouts&mdash;that is
to say, about 5&frac12; pecks in English measure. The price
of <i>farinha</i> on the coast would be less than four shillings
for that quantity.</p>

<p>What interested me most among the Mundurucus
was their strange ornamentations. The angular pattern
was a great favourite with them, especially angles
side by side, and the cross&mdash;which I think had been
suggested, however, by their contact with Catholic
missionaries farther down the river.</p>

<p>The rudimentary figures which they carved&mdash;merely
lines for the body, legs and arms, and a dot for the head&mdash;were
extraordinary because they represented the
body and limbs covered with hair, done simply by
minor parallel lines. I asked the Mundurucus why
they represented human beings with hair, whereas they
themselves were hairless on the body and face. They
said it was because in ancient times all the people were
hairy like monkeys.</p>

<p>I was strongly impressed by the difference in type<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-254" id="Pg_2-254"></a>[<a href="images/2-254.png">254</a>]</span>
between those Indians and the Bororos, and also by
the great difference in their language. When later on
I came in contact with the Apiacars, another tribe of
Indians living on the Tapajoz River, and closely allied
to the Mundurucus, I discovered that their language
bore a certain resemblance, curiously enough, to that
of the Maya Indians of Yucatan in Central America.</p>

<p>I had been so busy taking notes of all I had seen
in the <i>aldeja</i>, that when we started once more down the
river I did not at first miss my best dog, Negrino, of
whom I had got very fond. We had gone some 4 or
5 kil. down the river when I discovered that my men
had given it away to the Indians while I was occupied
studying the geological formation of that part of the
country. It was impossible to go back all those kilometres
against the current to recover the poor dog.
Although it gave me a great deal of pain I never for
one moment let the men see it, as I knew that it was
in order to hurt me that they had disposed of Negrino.</p>

<p>It is never right or useful to take revenge, for
if you wait long enough you are always avenged by
Providence. That afternoon my men saw some wild
chestnuts on a tree, and they insisted on landing to
pick them. They knocked down the tree, as usual, to
get the chestnuts, although it was fully 3 ft. in diameter.
They picked a great many of the wild chestnuts
and proceeded to eat them&mdash;Alcides, much to
my amazement, actually offering me one. I asked
them if they knew what they were eating, as I quickly
observed when the tree fell down that not a single
chestnut had been touched by birds or monkeys.</p>

<p>I have always noticed in equatorial countries that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-255" id="Pg_2-255"></a>[<a href="images/2-255.png">255</a>]</span>
if you never touch fruit that monkeys do not eat you
will seldom get poisoned. My men said that they had
never seen the fruit before, but as it looked pretty they
were going to eat it, and a lot of it. So they stopped
some time cracking the nuts and eating them with
great delight.</p>

<p>When we got back to the canoe we had only gone
a short distance when Filippe the negro was seized
with violent pains in his inside. His eyes had become
sunken, his lips were quivering, and in a moment he
was seized with cramps all over the body&mdash;so much
so that he collapsed.</p>

<p>We had to halt on a small island of rock, where we
took Filippe out and I had him laid flat on his chest,
he being just like a corpse. I inserted a leather strap
into his throat in order to cause immediate vomiting,
then I unpacked some of the castor oil which still remained
in my possession&mdash;we never seemed to lose the
beastly stuff&mdash;and gave him a dose powerful enough
to kill an ox.</p>

<p>The other men were laughing all the time, saying
that they felt no pain at all; but their boast did not
last long, for a few moments later, while I was watching
poor Filippe, Antonio and the man X threw themselves
down on the rocks, rolling over and contorting
themselves, evidently in most excruciating pain.</p>

<p>The same treatment was applied to them in turn,
and I watched with great concern three men out of
the six spread out helpless, and in such a dreadful
condition that I really doubted whether they would be
alive in another hour. I considered myself fortunate
that the other three had not been poisoned.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-256" id="Pg_2-256"></a>[<a href="images/2-256.png">256</a>]</span>
Half an hour later&mdash;it was impossible to move on
with the three men lying helpless on the rocks&mdash;Filippe
the white man and Benedicto also collapsed.
Again the same treatment once more.</p>

<p>Alcides looked at the other men with an air of
contempt and said: "They are rotten fellows! They
cannot eat anything without getting poisoned. I feel
no pain at all; the fruit has done me no harm."</p>

<p>When I turned round to look at his face it had
turned a lemon-yellow colour, which I did not quite
like, but I did not mention the fact to him, and went
about from one dejected man to another to try and
bring them back to life again.</p>

<p>Filippe the negro opened his eyes for a moment.
"I am dying!" he said. "Good-bye, sir! Please
give all my money to my sweetheart in Araguary."</p>

<p>I noted her name and address in my book, for I
really thought Filippe was about to expire.</p>

<p>The moans and groans all round me were most
funereal, and the odour unbearable, the nuts having
formed a chemical combination in their insides which
made their breath most offensive. The heat in the sun
was oppressive on those volcanic rocks. My bare feet
were absolutely scorched as I walked on them.</p>

<p>Not many minutes later Alcides was rolling himself
upon the rocks in intense pain. When I rushed
to him to apply my favourite method he rebelled,
refusing the treatment.</p>

<p>"Very good," I said to him; "will you live or
will you die?"</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill2-256.jpg"><img src="images/ill2-256_th.jpg" alt="Leading the Empty Canoe down a Dangerous Channel." title="Leading the Empty Canoe down a Dangerous Channel." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Leading the Empty Canoe down a Dangerous Channel.</p>
<p class="figcenter">(Photographed a few seconds before the rope snapped and canoe escaped.)</p>
<hr />
<p>"I prefer to die," said he, and proceeded to moan
and groan, and also to dictate the name and address<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-257" id="Pg_2-257"></a>[<a href="images/2-257.png">257</a>]</span>
of his sweetheart in Araguary for me to pay to her the
money which belonged to him.</p>

<p>In a way I was sorry to see my men suffering so
much. I was already thinking of how I could get out
of that difficult dilemma. If they had all died it
would have been out of the question for me to work
the huge canoe alone going down such dangerous rapids.</p>

<p>Some four hours were spent in deepest reflection,
a little distance off from my men. I had done my best,
and I could do no more for them. I returned every
little while to see how they were progressing, but for
the first three hours they were in so pitiful a condition
that I really thought they could not possibly recover.</p>

<p>When Alcides was almost unconscious I applied to
him also the remedy I had used for the other men.</p>

<p>It was only after some five hours or so that Filippe
the negro began to feel a little better. Gradually one
after another the men, half-dazed, were able to get
up, swaying about as if badly intoxicated. They said
they saw all the things in front of them moving up and
down. Evidently the poison had affected their vision
and also their hearing, as they said they could only
hear me faintly when I spoke to them.</p>

<p>Late in the evening I persuaded them to get once
more into the canoe, as it was not possible to camp
on those rocks. We floated down&mdash;fortunately for us
the river was placid for some 15 kil., and we let the
current do most of the work&mdash;I steering while all my
men lay flat in the bottom of the canoe. We passed
along two or three beautiful islands with quantities of
rubber upon them.</p>

<p>My men felt very bad the entire night, but by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-258" id="Pg_2-258"></a>[<a href="images/2-258.png">258</a>]</span>
next morning they were a little better, although in a
most exhausted condition. We had a minimum temperature
of 72&deg; F. during the night of August 17th.</p>

<p>We had some luck that evening, for we came to the
hut of a <i>seringueiro</i>, a negro, and his wife, who had cut
down a portion of the forest near their hut and cultivated
some <i>mandioca</i>. Their amazement at seeing us
appear was curious to watch, especially when they
looked at our canoe&mdash;held together with pieces of rope
and stopped up with pieces of our garments.</p>

<p>Those poor people, stranded there without a possibility
of getting away, were extremely kind. My men
heard with delight that we should find no rapids of
great importance from that point down stream, and
that we might find a few other <i>seringueiros</i> on our way.</p>

<p>I was able to buy from the <i>seringueiro</i> a quantity
of food, my men being overjoyed at the prospect of
eating <i>feij&atilde;o</i> again with their meals. Naturally the expense
of taking food so far up the river was very great,
and I was glad indeed to pay the exorbitant price
which the <i>seringueiro</i> asked of &pound;10 sterling for each
50 kilos of <i>farinha</i>; <i>feij&atilde;o</i> at 6<i>s.</i> a pound; sugar at 5<i>s.</i>
a pound&mdash;the prices which the <i>seringueiros</i> themselves
had to pay for those commodities from the rare
trading boats which once a year reached that farthermost
point.</p>

<p>We started down stream once more, passing a
tributary stream, 5 m. wide, on the left bank. We
had only gone 9 kil. when to our great joy we
met two trading-boats owned by a Brazilian Jew, who
was on board in a critical condition from malarial
fever. Although in a dying state, he had not lost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-259" id="Pg_2-259"></a>[<a href="images/2-259.png">259</a>]</span>
his racial commercial ability. It was most interesting
to watch his expiring countenance while trying
to strike the best bargain possible. He sold me
sixty candles for 60<i>s.</i>, eight biscuits for the equivalent
of 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and a quantity of dried meat at 5<i>s.</i> a
pound.</p>

<p>He looked askance at us, as he could not make out
who we were, what we were doing up that river, where
we could have come from. At last he signed to me
that he had something to whisper in my ear. He
asked me if I was a runaway cashier from a bank! I
told him that if I had been a runaway cashier I would
certainly not come and spend my money on the Arinos-Juruena
River.</p>

<p>The sight of human beings again&mdash;if that term could
be applied indiscriminately to all we had met so far&mdash;had
greatly excited my men.</p>

<p>Some 13 kil. farther, the river being smooth but
swift, we came to a basin 700 m. broad, where the
river described a turn toward the north-east. We
came upon a large clearing on the hill-side on the left
bank. There we saw the remains of two or three huts
which had been destroyed by fire. We perceived one or
two people, and we landed. We found that it was the
shed of an enterprising Peruvian trader who had
established himself there in order to collect rubber.
Only a few days before we arrived a great fire had
taken place, which had destroyed nearly all he possessed;
but&mdash;fortunately for us&mdash;they had saved a
few things, and I was able to purchase a quantity of
rice, biscuits, dried meat, beans, <i>farinha</i>, condensed
milk, <i>banho</i> (liquid lard in tins), and a number of other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-260" id="Pg_2-260"></a>[<a href="images/2-260.png">260</a>]</span>
things, such as clothes, shirts, rope, nails, axes, etc.,
which we needed badly.</p>

<p>The Peruvian trader&mdash;of the Brothers Mori's firm&mdash;must
have had a handsome store indeed at that place,
a quantity of jewellery, rifles, pistols, etc., all badly
injured by the fire, being seen strewn on the ground
as we walked about.</p>

<p>The Peruvians are wonderful traders, most remarkable
people for exploring unknown regions and
carrying on commerce to the most distant points where
human beings are found. That particular Peruvian firm
had foreseen that that region will some day develop
to a great extent, and they had therefore established
their store at the most distant point where it was
possible to navigate the river without extraordinary
dangers.</p>

<p>The prices charged by the Peruvian, even when
circumstances might have led him to put a high price
on the goods he sold me, were far lower than those of
the Jew in his dying moments.</p>

<p>The river was there 1,000 m. wide, and of amazing
beauty, flowing to 30&deg; b.m. N.N.E. for 5,000 m. in a
direct line.</p>

<p>We had gone 30 kil. that day, and we had had so
many things happen to us, we felt so rich and happy
with our new purchases and with the prospect that
our trials were nearly over, that when night came we
had a grand meal, and slept soundly notwithstanding
the swarms of mosquitoes which buzzed around
us.</p>

<p class="fsc">The S. Sim&atilde;o Waterfall.</p>
<hr />
<p>During the night of August 18th the minimum temperature
was 71&deg; F. During the day the temperature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-261" id="Pg_2-261"></a>[<a href="images/2-261.png">261</a>]</span>
of the air was not much warmer&mdash;only 78&deg; F. in the
shade with a nice breeze, while 113&deg; F. were registered
in the sun.</p>

<p>We halted for one day in order to repair the canoe,
as it was all we could do to keep her afloat, she was
leaking so badly. Poor Benedicto, who had spent the
last few weeks baling out the water, swore that the
moment he could leave the expedition he certainly
would, since he felt he should turn into a fish soon, as
he had not been dry one second for the last two
months.</p>

<p>The minimum temperature during the night of
August 19th was 72&deg; F.</p>

<p>When we proceeded down the river we came upon
most beautiful sand beaches, one as much as 500 m.
long. Quantities of most delicious tortoise eggs were
to be found. Furthermore, we killed some giant
tortoises. Altogether we felt that all of a sudden we
had dropped from a regular inferno into a heaven on
earth.</p>

<p>My men were paddling away with great vigour and
were making rapid progress, the river flowing almost
all the time northward, with deviations of a few degrees
toward the east, in stretches from 2,000 to 6,000 m.
in length. We crossed an immense basin 1,500 m.
broad with most gorgeous sand beaches. Their formation
in small dunes, occasionally with an edge like the
teeth of a double comb, was most interesting. Once
or twice we came to musical sands such as we had
found before. Everywhere on those beaches I noticed
the wonderful miniature sand plants, of which I made
a complete collection.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-262" id="Pg_2-262"></a>[<a href="images/2-262.png">262</a>]</span>
As we went down we came to one or two <i>seringueiros</i>'
huts, and to a store belonging to our friend
the dying Jew, who rejoiced in the name of Moses.
As he had taken all the stuff with him in the trading
boat in order to exchange it for rubber from the
collectors, he had left nothing in the store except a
cheap straw hat.</p>

<p>As my hat by that time had lost most of its brim,
and the top of it had got loose and was moving up and
down in the breeze, I thought I would not lose the
opportunity of getting new headgear. So the purchase
was made there and then, and thus fashionably
attired I started once more down stream.</p>

<p>We passed on the way most impressive sand banks
and beaches&mdash;500, 700, and one 1,500 m. long. The
river in some spots was 1,000 m. wide. A great island
4,000 m. in length&mdash;Bertino Miranda Island&mdash;was then
passed, with a beautiful spit of sand 15 ft. high at its
southern end. Hillocks were visible first on the left
bank, then on the right. Other elongated sand accumulations
of great length were found beyond the big
island, one a huge tail of sand extending towards the
north for 1,000 m. Beyond those accumulations the
river was not less than 1500 m. across, and there an
immense beach of really extraordinary beauty ran on
the right side for a length of 1&frac12; kil.</p>

<p>On that beach we halted for lunch. In the afternoon
we continued, between banks on either side of
alluvial formation, principally silts and clay, light grey in
colour or white. In fact, the soil in the section directly
below the higher terrace of the great central plateau
of Matto Grosso, was formed by extensive alluvial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-263" id="Pg_2-263"></a>[<a href="images/2-263.png">263</a>]</span>
accumulations which had made an immense terrace
extending right across all Central Brazil from west to
east, roughly speaking from the Madeira River to the
Araguaya and beyond.</p>

<p>After we had gone some 5 kil. in a straight line
from our camp to 10&deg; b.m., we perceived a headland
with a hill upon it 200 ft. high. We had been greatly
troubled in the afternoon for the last two days by
heavy showers of rain and gusts of a north-westerly
wind. Once or twice we got entangled in channels
among the many islands, and had to retrace our course,
but we went on until late in the evening, my men
believing firmly that we had now reached civilization
again and that the journey would be over in a few
days. I did not care to disillusion them.</p>

<p>Late at night we camped on a magnificent beach,
1,000 m. long, at the end of Araujo Island, 1,200 m.
in length.</p>

<p>We had gone that day, August 19th, 46 kil. 500 m.</p>

<p>My men hung their hammocks on the edge of the
forest. That camp was extremely damp and unhealthy.
When we woke up the next morning all my
followers were attacked by fever and were shivering
with cold.</p>

<p>We left at 7.30 a.m. under a limpid sky of gorgeous
cobalt blue. We passed two islands&mdash;one 700 m. long
(Leda Island), the other 2,000 m. (Leander Island).
When we had gone but 11,500 m. we arrived at
one of the most beautiful bits of river scenery I
have ever gazed upon&mdash;the spot where the immense
S. Manoel River or Tres Barras or Paranatinga met the
Arinos-Juruena. The latter river at that spot de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-264" id="Pg_2-264"></a>[<a href="images/2-264.png">264</a>]</span>scribed
a sharp turn from 20&deg; b.m. to 320&deg; b.m. We
perceived a range of hills before us to the north. Close
to the bank gradually appeared a large shed with a
clearing near it on a high headland some 200 ft. above
the level of the river where the stream turned. On
the left bank, before we arrived at the meeting-place of
those two giant streams, we found a tributary, the
Bararati, 30 m. broad.</p>

<p>The S. Manoel River showed in its centre an elongated
island stretching in an E.N.E. direction. Where
the Arinos-Juruena met the S. Manoel it was 1,000 m.
wide, the S. Manoel being 800 m. wide at the point of
junction.</p>

<p>No sooner had we turned to 320&deg; b.m. than we
perceived on our left the <i>collectoria</i> of S. Manoel, with
two or three neat buildings. Several astonished people
rushed down to the water as they saw the canoe
approaching. When I landed the Brazilian official in
charge of that place and his assistants embraced me
tenderly and took me inside their house. When I told
them how we had come down the river, tears streamed
down their cheeks, so horrified were they.</p>

<p>"Did you come in that log of wood?" said the
collector, pointing to my canoe. I said I had. "Good
gracious me!" he exclaimed. "I will not let you go
another yard in that dangerous conveyance. I will
confiscate it, as I need a trough for my pigs and it will
just do for that purpose, and not for navigating a dangerous
river like this. If you want to go on by river
I will supply you with a good boat."</p>

<p>That was the last time I put my foot inside my
canoe. I removed for good the British flag which had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-265" id="Pg_2-265"></a>[<a href="images/2-265.png">265</a>]</span>
flown daily at her stern, and it gave me quite a <i>serrement

nose and said good-bye to her for ever. Notwithstanding
her miserable appearance she had done really
remarkable work.</p>

Rubber&mdash;Unexploited Regions&mdash;Precious Fossils thrown away by

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> State of Matto Grosso had recently established a
fiscal agency at the junction of the two rivers in order
to collect the tax on the rubber exported from that
region. The Fiscal Agent, Mr. Jos&eacute; Sotero Barretto,
and his assistant, Mr. Julio Vieira Nery, were intelligent
and polished gentlemen. Their predecessor was not
like them. His barbarity, not only to the Apiacar
Indians but also to the Brazilians in his employ, was
almost incredible. For no reason whatever he killed
men right and left, until one day as he was getting
out of his canoe one of his men shot him in the back.</p>

<p>So much has been said of late of atrocities in the
Putumayo Region that perhaps one may be allowed
to say that the Putumayo Region is not the only
place where atrocities have occurred. To any one not
acquainted with those regions it is difficult to understand
why those atrocities take place at all. Curiously
enough, they are due to a large extent to medicine.
Those regions are all extremely malarial. The people
who are ordered there are afraid of being infected long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-267" id="Pg_2-267"></a>[<a href="images/2-267.png">267</a>]</span>
before they start on their journey. They begin taking
preventive quinine and arsenic, which renders them
most irritable and ill-tempered; the solitude preys
upon them, and they add to the poisoning from medicine
the evil effects of excessive drinking. Add again to
this that few men can manage to be brave for a long
period of time, and that the brain gradually becomes
unbalanced, and you have the reason why murders are
committed wholesale in a stupid effort chiefly to preserve
oneself.</p>

<p>The Apiacar Indians, I was told, were formerly
much more numerous in that region than at present.
Most of them had been killed off, and their women
stolen. When Mr. Barretto arrived at the <i>collectoria</i> he
had great trouble in persuading the Indians to come
near him; but he has been so extremely kind to them
that now the entire tribe&mdash;some twenty people&mdash;have
established themselves at the <i>collectoria</i> itself, where
they are given work to do as police, rubber collectors,
and agriculturists combined. Mr. Barretto and his
assistant were much respected and loved by the natives.
Unlike his predecessor, he treated them with the greatest
consideration and generosity.</p>

<p>Mr. Barretto furnished me with an interesting table
showing the amount of production and export of
rubber from that district for the year 1910. From this
table it appears that from May 3rd to December 31st
30,356 kil. of the finest quality rubber, 10,153 kil. of
<i>sernamby</i> (or scrap rubber), 4,858 kil. of <i>caoutchouc</i>, and
30,655 kil. of <i>sernamby caoutchouc</i>&mdash;altogether a total of
76,022 kil.&mdash;passed through the <i>collectoria</i> on the Matto
Grosso side, which does not include the opposite side<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-268" id="Pg_2-268"></a>[<a href="images/2-268.png">268</a>]</span>
of the river, belonging to the Province of Para, where
another <i>collectoria</i> has been established. That quantity
of rubber had been collected by some eighty people,
all told, including the local Indians.</p>

<hr />
<p>It was impossible to get labour up that river. The
few <i>seringueiros</i>, chiefly negroes who were there in
absolute slavery, had been led and established by their
masters up the river, with no chance of getting away.
Their masters came, of course, every year to bring
down the rubber that had been collected. Twenty
times the quantity could easily be brought down to
the coast if labour were obtainable. Not only was the
Juruena River itself almost absolutely untouched commercially&mdash;as
we have seen, we did not meet a soul
during the fifty days we navigated it&mdash;but even important
tributaries close to S. Manoel, such as the
Euphrasia, the S&atilde;o Thom&eacute;, the S&atilde;o Florencio, the
Misericordia, and others, were absolutely desert regions,
although the quantity of rubber to be found along those
streams must be immense. The difficulty of transport,
even on the Tapajoz&mdash;from the junction of the two
rivers the Juruena took the name of Tapajoz River&mdash;was
very great, although the many rapids there encountered
were mere child's play in comparison with
those we had met with up above. In them, nevertheless,
many lives were lost and many valuable cargoes
disappeared for ever yearly. The rubber itself was not
always lost when boats were wrecked, as rubber floats,
and some of it was generally recovered. The expense
of a journey up that river was enormous; it took forty
to sixty days from the mouth of the Tapajoz to reach
the <i>collectoria</i> of S. Manoel. Thus, on an average the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-269" id="Pg_2-269"></a>[<a href="images/2-269.png">269</a>]</span>
cost of freight on each kilo (about 2 lb.) of rubber
between those two points alone was not less than
sevenpence or eightpence.</p>

<p>As the River Tapajoz is extremely tortuous and
troublesome, I think that some day, in order to exploit
that region fully, it will be found necessary to cut a
road through the forest from S. Manoel to one of the
tributaries of the Madeira, such as the River Secundury-Canuma,
from which the rubber could be taken down
to the Amazon in a few days.</p>

<p>From the point of junction of the River Tres Barras
or S. Manoel and the Juruena, the river was fairly well
known. It was partly in order to ascertain whether
the project of the road from S. Manoel to the Madeira
were feasible, that I decided to leave the river and
cross the forest due west as far as the Madeira River.</p>

<p>I spent two or three most delightful days enjoying
the generous hospitality of Mr. Barretto. I was able to
purchase from him a quantity of provisions, enough to
last us some three months, and consisting of tinned
food, rice, beans, <i>farinha</i>, sugar, coffee, and dried meat.</p>

<p>Mr. Barretto kindly arranged to send his assistant,
Mr. Julio Nery, and three Apiacar Indians in order to
help me along during the first two or three days of our
journey into the forest.</p>

<p>As I should be travelling on foot from that point
across virgin forest, and we should have to carry
whatever baggage we had, it was necessary for me to
abandon all the things which were not of absolute importance,
so as to make the loads as light as possible.</p>

<p>I left behind at S. Manoel a tent, some of my rifles,
a quantity of cartridges, etc., the only articles I took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-270" id="Pg_2-270"></a>[<a href="images/2-270.png">270</a>]</span>
along with me besides provisions being my cameras,
instruments, the photographic plates already exposed,
with some two hundred plates for further work, and
the geological and botanical collections, which by that
time had got to be valuable.</p>

<p>As I was unpacking the different cases in order to
sort out the baggage, I came to the box where I expected
to find the precious fossil human skull and the
vertebr&aelig; I had discovered in Matto Grosso. To my
horror the fossils were to be found nowhere. I asked
Alcides and the other men, and pressed them for an
answer. I received a terrible blow indeed when they
confessed that nearly a month before, one night while
I was asleep, they had taken the valuable possessions
and had flung them into the river. Their excuse was
that the loads were heavy enough in carting baggage
along the rapids, and they would not be burdened with
what they called "stupid stones."</p>

<p>This last bit of infamy turned me so much against
my men that I could not bear the sight of them. It
will be easily understood that when you go to such
great expense and risk as I did in obtaining valuable
material, and had obtained it, to be deprived of it
through the ignorance and meanness of one's own men,
who were treated with the greatest generosity from
beginning to end, was certainly most exasperating.
In a half-hearted way I packed up all the other things
and made ready to continue the journey. The contempt
I had for my men from that day, nevertheless,
made it quite painful to me to be in their company.
At S. Manoel the men gave me no end of trouble.
Benedicto refused to go on any longer. The other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-271" id="Pg_2-271"></a>[<a href="images/2-271.png">271</a>]</span>
men wanted to halt there for a month in order to
recuperate their strength. Filippe the negro was
drunk, and slept all the time we were there.</p>

<p>I know too well that on expeditions it is fatal to
halt anywhere; therefore I was anxious to push on
at once. The night before our departure Mr. Barretto
gave a grand dinner-party in my honour, long speeches
being read out by him and his assistant, when we sat
down on rough wooden benches and packing-cases to
a most elaborate meal of fried fish, grilled fish, boiled
fish, tortoise eggs&mdash;quantities of them&mdash;stewed pork
and roast pork. A whole sucking-pig adorned the
table. The greatest happiness reigned that night at
table, and I owe a deep debt of gratitude to Mr. Barretto
for his exquisite kindness during the two or
three days I was his guest. My men were also asked
to the banquet, and had a good fill. But I felt extremely
sad, quite broken-hearted, over the loss of the
fossils, and I could really enjoy nothing notwithstanding
outward appearances.</p>

<p>After dinner, when my men had retired, Mr. Barretto
and his assistant expressed great surprise at my
not having been murdered by my followers before then.
They said that in their whole experience they had never
come across such impossible creatures. They could
not understand how the Governor of Goyaz could
possibly let me start in such company. They seemed
most anxious for me, as some of my men had evidently,
while drunk, spoken at the <i>collectoria</i> and said things
which had greatly upset and frightened the fiscal
agent.</p>

<p>Three days after my arrival in S. Manoel I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-272" id="Pg_2-272"></a>[<a href="images/2-272.png">272</a>]</span>
ready to depart, having conceived a plan to go some
60 kil. farther by river to a point from where I would
strike due west across the forest as far as the Madeira
River. I was just about to go on board the boat
placed at my disposal by Mr. Barretto, when a terrific
storm broke out, with lightning and thunder, and a
howling wind which blew with fury, raising high waves
in the river&mdash;very wide at that point. It was a wonderful
spectacle, with the river in commotion and the
dazzling flashes of lightning across the inky sky.
Amidst it I saw my faithful canoe being dashed mercilessly
by the waves time after time against some sharp
rocks, until she broke in two and foundered. I was
sorry to see her disappear, for she had served me well.</p>

<p>When after a couple of hours the storm cleared, I
took my departure, on August 24th. During my stay
at S. Manoel I had taken observations for latitude
(7&deg; 16&#8242;&middot;9 S.), longitude (58&deg; 34&#8242; W.), and elevation
(601 ft. a.s.l. on the river, 721 ft. at the <i>collectoria</i>).</p>

<p class="fsc">Author taking Astronomical Observations on a Sandy Beach of the River Arinos-Juruena.</p>
<hr />
<p>Just across the river, at the mouth of the Tres
Barras, was the <i>collectoria</i> for the State of Par&aacute;. The
Par&aacute; <i>seringueiros</i> worked on the Rio Tres Barras and its
tributaries on its right side&mdash;that is to say, the Annipir&iacute;,
the Igarap&eacute; Preto, the Cururu, and another (nameless)
stream. There were, perhaps, altogether some eighty
or a hundred <i>seringueiros</i>, all told, working in that
immense region on the Par&aacute; side. In the year 1910,
90,000 kil. of rubber were collected by those few
<i>seringueiros</i>, and in the year 1911 a slightly larger
amount was sent down the river from that point. The
Par&aacute; Fiscal Agency was only established there on
December 11th, 1910. The <i>collectoria</i> was situated in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-273" id="Pg_2-273"></a>[<a href="images/2-273.png">273</a>]</span>
a most beautiful spot on a high point overlooking the
mouth of the Tres Barras, and directly facing the
Juruena-Arinos. On the Juruena previous to reaching
S. Manoel on the left side was a stream in which gold
was to be found.</p>

<p>Amid the affectionate farewells of Mr. Barretto I
left S. Manoel in a beautiful boat belonging to the
fiscal agent. The effects of light on the water were
wonderful after the storm. The river, immensely wide,
flowed in a N.N.W. direction, then due north in great
straight stretches from 2 to 4 kil. in length. As we
had left late in the afternoon we were not able to
go far. We passed some beautiful islands, one particularly
of immense length, with an extensive sandy
beach at its southern end. After going some 18 kil.
we came to a great barrier of rocks extending across
the river from south-west to north-east. Some distance
below those rocks a great sand-bank spread half-way
across the stream.</p>

<p>We halted for the night at the <i>fazenda</i> of Colonel
Gregorio, a <i>seringueiro</i> from whom I expected to get
an Indian who knew the forest well and who could be
of some assistance to me in going across it. The house
of Col. Gregorio&mdash;a mere big shed&mdash;was a regular
armoury, a great many rifles of all ages, sizes, and
shapes adorning the walls; then there were fishing
spears and harpoons, vicious-looking knives and axes.
In the principal room was a large altar with a carved
figure of the Virgin standing with joined hands before
lighted candles and a bottle of green peppermint. The
latter was not an offering to the sacred image, but
it was placed on the revered spot so that none of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-274" id="Pg_2-274"></a>[<a href="images/2-274.png">274</a>]</span>
Gregorio's men should touch it. Enormous balls of
rubber filled the greater portion of the floor, waiting
to be taken down the river.</p>

<p>With great trouble the Indian&mdash;a man called
Miguel&mdash;was induced to accompany me; also a young
boy, who, at a salary of 15<i>s.</i> a day, agreed to act as
carrier.</p>

<p>It was not until late in the afternoon on August 25th
that we left the <i>fazenda</i> in order to proceed down the
stream. We passed the tributary river Roncador on
the left side, with its beautiful high waterfall a short
distance before it enters the Tapajoz. We came soon
afterwards to the island of S. Benedicto, south of
which on the left bank was the hill of the Veado, 120 ft.
high. Directly in front of the island, also on the left
bank, was the Mount of S. Benedicto, where legends
say an image of that saint exists carved out by nature
in the high rocky cliff.</p>

<p>As we passed under the hill our crew fired
several volleys in honour of the saint; then we landed
and I climbed up to go and see the wonderful image.
Many candles had been burnt on a platform of rock
on the cliff side, and the sailors who came up with me
brought a new supply of stearine and set them ablaze
on that natural altar. The men pointed out to me the
figure of the saint, but with all the best intentions in
the world I could see no resemblance whatever to a
human being.</p>

<p>"There it is! there it is!" they shouted, as I
twisted my head one way and the other to see if I
could find a point of view from which I could see the
saint. The men knelt down and prayed fervently for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-275" id="Pg_2-275"></a>[<a href="images/2-275.png">275</a>]</span>
some minutes, as they believed it was necessary to
pay these signs of respect in order to ensure a good
journey down the river. Some went as far as to tear
off pieces of their garments and leave them on the
rocky platform as offerings.</p>

<p>The eastern face of the S. Benedicto Mount was a
vertical wall 200 ft. high in horizontal strata of a deep
grey colour, and some 300 m. in length along the river.</p>

<p>We had wasted so much time, and the men rowed
so badly, that we made poor progress. We only went
21 kil. that day. We halted for the night near a
<i>seringueiro's</i> hut at the small rapid of Meia Carga, or
Half-charge Rapid, because at low water the boats
have to be half unloaded in order to get over that spot.</p>

<p>The minimum temperature during the night was
69&deg; F. We slept in the boat, and were simply devoured
by mosquitoes. The chief of the Indians who had
been lent me by the Fiscal Agent became seriously ill
during the night with a severe attack of fever. All
my men, with no exception, also became ill, and were
shivering with cold, owing to fever. The chief of the
police, Luiz Perreira da Silva, who had been placed by
Mr. Barretto in charge of the Indians who were to
accompany me, in jumping from the boat that night
on to the shore hurt his foot, the pain caused by that
slight injury giving him also a severe attack of fever.
So that of the entire crew there remained only two
men in good health&mdash;viz. Mr. Julio Nery and myself.</p>

<p>Amid moans and groans we got the boat under way
at 6.45 the next morning, the men paddling in a half-hearted
manner. As the current was strong we drifted
down fairly quickly in a northerly direction, the river<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-276" id="Pg_2-276"></a>[<a href="images/2-276.png">276</a>]</span>
there being in a perfectly straight line for some 8,000 m.
The width of the river was 1,300 m.</p>

<p>Behind a little island on the left side, and approached
through a circle of dangerous rocks, was the
hut of a <i>seringueiro</i> called Albuquerque, a man in the
employ of Colonel Brazil, the greatest rubber trader on
the river Tapajoz. We landed at that point and made
preparations so that I could start at once on the
journey on foot across the virgin forest.</p>

<p>The loads the men were to carry were not heavy&mdash;merely
from 35 to 40 lb. each&mdash;the heaviest load
being the one I carried, so as to give a good example
to my men. We had ample provisions to last us, with
a little economy, three months. When the moment
arrived to depart there was not one man who could
stand up on his legs; the policeman with his injured
foot could not even land from the boat, as it gave him
so much pain. The chief of the Indians was so ill
with the fever and the medicine he had taken that he
really looked as if he might not survive. The other
Indians refused to leave their chief; while the Indian
Miguel, whom I had employed subsequently, flatly
refused to come along. Much time was wasted talking,
Mr. Nery, a fluent speaker, haranguing the men, who
lay around helpless, holding their heads between their
hands or rolling themselves on the ground.</p>

<p>It is extraordinary how many ailments fright can
produce.</p>

<p>The accounts of the forest which I had heard in the
neighbourhood were most conflicting. It was really
impossible to tell beforehand what the crossing overland
between the Tapajoz and the Madeira River would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-277" id="Pg_2-277"></a>[<a href="images/2-277.png">277</a>]</span>
be like. In order to encourage my own men I had
once more increased their pay for the extra hard work
I required of them on that occasion, and I promised
them each a further present of money if they succeeded
in carrying all the loads safely as far as the
Madeira River.</p>

<p>They had agreed to do the work, but unfortunately
they were the most unpractical men I have ever come
across, and insisted on carrying the loads in a way
which made it impossible for them to carry them for
any long distance. For instance, one man insisted on
carrying a heavy wooden packing-case slung on one
side of the body just over the hip, in the fashion in
which Italians carry barrel-organs in the streets of
cities; another man suspended a case on his back
by a strap which went round his neck, so that after
a few minutes he was absolutely strangled; while
Filippe the negro let his load hang so low that it would
certainly cause a bad sore on his spine. I tried to
teach them, but it was no use, as it only led to a row.
Absolutely disgusted with the whole crowd of them,
late that afternoon of August 26th I made ready to
start on our difficult journey.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">By</span> three o'clock in the afternoon I had been able to
induce the Indian Miguel, his friend the carrier, and
three other Apiacar Indians to come along with us for
a few days in order to carry the heavier packages as
far as possible into the forest, so that I could spare
my men.</p>

<p>It was some relief to me&mdash;although I saw plainly
that we should surely have disaster sooner or later&mdash;when
one after the other my men took up their loads
and started off. I gave them the correct direction
with the compass, almost due west; in fact, to make
it easier for them I told them that afternoon to travel
in the direction of the sun.</p>

<p>With Filippe the negro at the head my own men
started off at a rapid pace, the others following, while
I was at the tail of the procession in order to see that
no stragglers remained behind. For a short distance
we found an old <i>picada</i> which went practically in the
direction we wanted, so my men followed it, only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-279" id="Pg_2-279"></a>[<a href="images/2-279.png">279</a>]</span>
cutting when necessary the vegetation which had grown
up here and there.</p>

<p>I had only gone a few hundred metres when I saw
the ground a little way off our track covered with
some white substance. With my usual curiosity I
went to see what it was, and found to my disgust a
large quantity of rice which had evidently been scattered
about there a few moments before. A few yards
farther was another patch of white upon the ground,
as if it had snowed. A whole sack of flour had been
emptied and scattered about in such a way that it
could not be recovered.</p>

<p>I well knew what was happening. My men were
throwing away everything in order to make the loads
lighter. So relieved of the weight, they had got far
ahead, while the Apiacar Indians who had remained
behind were behaving in so strange a fashion that I
had to stay in charge of them, so that they should not
escape with the boxes of instruments and collections
which they were carrying for me.</p>

<p>We went that afternoon some 6 kil. through fairly
clean forest, barring a few obstacles such as huge,
ancient, fallen trees, the insides of which were all
rotted away or eaten up by ants. In one of the cavities
of those trees I found another quantity of food which
had been hidden by my men. Hampered by the
Indians, who were giving me no end of trouble as they
refused to carry their loads, it took me some little time
to catch up with my other men. When I did I found
them all seated, smacking their lips. They were
filling their mouths as fast as they could with handfuls
of sugar. When I reprimanded them there was an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-280" id="Pg_2-280"></a>[<a href="images/2-280.png">280</a>]</span>
unpleasant row. They said they were not beasts of
burden, that men were not made to carry, and that
therefore they had thrown away all the food. Under
no circumstance would they carry loads any farther.</p>

<p>A great deal of tact and persuasion were required.
Alcides had discarded nearly all the stuff he carried,
and was one of the chief offenders on that occasion.</p>

<p>Matters looked bad. We camped that night near
a little streamlet at the point where it had its birth.
We still had plenty of food left, notwithstanding what
they had thrown away. I warned them that if they
threw away any more we should certainly all die
of starvation. During the night one of the Indians
ran away carrying with him a quantity of our provisions.</p>

<p>On August 27th I once more proceeded on the
march westward, this time with no <i>picada</i> at all to
follow, but cutting our way all the time through the
forest. Mr. Julio Nery, who had been sent with me,
was an enthusiastic and brave man, but in trying to
help made us waste a great deal of energy and time.
After marching eight hours we had only gone 10 kil.
in the right direction, having made many deviations
in order to find what he called a more suitable way.
We travelled occasionally over thickly wooded, slightly
undulating country, but generally the land was flat.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, when we arrived at the foot of a
small hill, we were caught in a drenching storm, the
foliage letting the water down upon us in profusion.
The walking became heavy. In order to make the
loads lighter, my men had removed from the packages
the waterproof coverings I had made for them from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-281" id="Pg_2-281"></a>[<a href="images/2-281.png">281</a>]</span>
waterproof sheets. The result was that in that storm
nearly our entire supply of salt&mdash;some 50 lb. of it&mdash;was
lost. The powdered sugar, too, suffered considerably,
and became a solid sticky mass.</p>

<p>We arrived at a stream 10 m. broad flowing from
north to south, where we had to halt, as my men said
they were absolutely exhausted and could not go
another step. The water of that stream was simply
delicious. We killed a monkey, which my men ate
eagerly for dinner.</p>

<p>On August 28th we left that stream at eight o'clock.
We were confronted by a succession of steep hills with
vertical rocks of immense size, on the summit of which
were great slabs also of rock, not unlike angular roofs of
houses. It was most difficult, I confess, for my men
to take the loads up and down those giant rocks,
especially as there were many fallen trees among them
and the rocks themselves were extremely slippery.</p>

<p>It would not do to repeat in these pages the language
of my men as they scrambled up and rolled
down the numerous rocks&mdash;falling so clumsily that
they always managed to injure themselves more or less.
I was sorry for my loads, especially the instruments,
which got knocked about in a pitiful way.</p>

<p>We came across three distinct hill ranges of that
type, over which we had to travel, the highest point
being some 300 ft. above the level of the Tapajoz
River. The last bit in particular of that hilly region
was diabolically steep, with loose rocks which gave us
no end of trouble. A beautiful little streamlet flowing
east descended in cascades among those huge rocks.
Eventually we reached the summit of the plateau, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-282" id="Pg_2-282"></a>[<a href="images/2-282.png">282</a>]</span>
huge flat expanse of dark red volcanic rock. My men
were so tired that we had to camp on that elevation.
Nothing but a few shrubs grew in the interstices of
that great table of rock, which extended for several
kilometres to the north. The barrier of rock, a spur
of the great central plateau, was very interesting from
a geological point of view.</p>

<p>On August 29th we again marched westward,
cutting our way through the forest, and found two
streamlets&mdash;one flowing south, the other north. Late
in the afternoon we arrived at a spot where there
was another great mass of rock, most troublesome
for us. My men were discontented, saying that when
they agreed to march through the forest they had
not agreed to march over rocks&mdash;as if I had placed
these there on purpose to annoy them. They were
extremely morose. I knew by their manner that I had
fresh trouble in store.</p>

<p>In the centre of that second immense table of rock
I found a few pools of putrid rain-water in cavities.
My men wanted to halt there, but I induced them to
march along in hopes of finding a stream at the bottom
of the tableland. Unluckily we went on and on until
the evening and we found no more water at all. Only
a torrential shower came upon us during the night,
and we were able to fill our cups with water to quench
our thirst. Men and baggage got soaked in that storm.
The loads were much heavier to carry the next morning.</p>

<p>On August 30th, when I called the men in order
to make a start, two of them were attacked severely
by fever, their temperature being 103&deg;. They seemed
to be in agony, and had no strength left.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-283" id="Pg_2-283"></a>[<a href="images/2-283.png">283</a>]</span>
Mr. Julio Nery said that his duties called him back
to his post, and he must return with the Indians under
his charge. He accompanied me up to lunch-time,
when we all together had a hearty meal. After lunch
I gave Mr. Nery and his men ample provisions to return
to the river Tapajoz, where the boat was awaiting
them. Not only that, but I presented Mr. Nery with
a handsome rifle and a watch, in remembrance of his
politeness to me. In order that he might have a
pleasant journey back I also gave him the few tins of
delicacies which I had brought for myself, the only
four tins of condensed milk I had been able to obtain
in S. Manoel, and a few tins of sardines which had
remained from my provisions I had taken over from
England, and which he liked very much.</p>

<p>It was a great trial to me to see how my men
wasted food all the time. When I examined the
loads once more I found that nearly the entire supply
of flour, <i>farinha</i>, rice, lard, and much of the tinned
stuff had been thrown away. We had been marching
four and a half days, and out of the three months'
provisions we only had food enough left to last us a
few days.</p>

<p>With my reduced party of my six original men,
the Indian Miguel and his friend the carrier&mdash;eight
altogether&mdash;I started once more in a westerly direction,
opening a <i>picada</i>&mdash;that is to say, cutting our way
through the forest.</p>

<p>We crossed two streamlets flowing north. After
that we came upon a most troublesome patch of
swampy land with high reeds in it, the leaves of which
cut our hands like razors when we forced our way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-284" id="Pg_2-284"></a>[<a href="images/2-284.png">284</a>]</span>
through them, struggling in mud and slush up to our
knees, sometimes as high as our waists. A streamlet
flowing north formed the marsh in that low place.
The moment we had got out of the marsh the men
threw themselves down and said they could go no
farther. I pointed out to them that that spot was
most unhealthy, and tried to persuade them to go some
distance from that pestilential place. But they would
not listen to reason, and there they would stay.</p>

<p>Although I had offered them every possible inducement
to come on&mdash;their original high pay had been
practically trebled as long as the hard work should last&mdash;and
I had treated them with the greatest consideration,
yet they refused to come any farther. They said
they had decided to go back.</p>

<p>In examining my loads I found that they had
abandoned my sextant and other instruments in the
forest, and it was only after a great deal of talking
that I could induce the man X to go back with me
to recover them, for which service he received an
immediate present of one pound sterling.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, that evening my men shot
a plump <i>jaho</i> (<i>Crypturus notivagus</i>) and a large <i>mutum</i>
(<i>Crax pinima</i>), two enormous birds, most excellent to eat.</p>

<hr />
<p>That camp was stifling, the moisture being excessive,
and the miasma rising from the putrid water
poisoning my men in a disastrous way. The drinking-water,
too, from that swamp was full of germs of all
sizes, so big that with the naked eye you could see
hundreds of them in your cup. We could not boil the
water because all our matches had got wet. We
wasted hundreds of them in trying to light a fire, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-285" id="Pg_2-285"></a>[<a href="images/2-285.png">285</a>]</span>
with no success. Flint and steel also proved useless,
because the wood was also soaking wet and would
not ignite.</p>

<p>August 31st was a painful day for me. Two of the
men were badly laid up with fever, the others were
most obnoxious. I had endless trouble in making
them take up their loads and start once more. The
man X said he would take the load which contained
my instruments, but he would certainly leave it, as
soon as he had an opportunity, concealed in a spot
where it could not be found again. I told him in plain
words that if he carried out his intention I would shoot
him dead, and I would from that moment do the same
to any other man who rebelled. I was surprised to
find that the lot of them took their loads upon their
shoulders and proceeded to march along as quietly as
possible.</p>

<p>The Brazilian forest was&mdash;unlike the equatorial
forest of Africa&mdash;comparatively clean underneath, there
being very little undergrowth. It was quite easy to
cut one's way through if one knew how. There was a
great art in cutting one's way through the forest. If
you happened to know the way trees grew or liane
were suspended, it was easy enough to cut them
with one sharp blow of the large knives. But if you
did not happen to know the formation of the trees
and you struck them the wrong way, you had to hit
them many times before you knocked them down.
The same thing and worse happened with liane, which
could be severed easily with one stroke if it were applied
the right way, but which wound round and entangled
you in a merciless manner if hit at a wrong angle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-286" id="Pg_2-286"></a>[<a href="images/2-286.png">286</a>]</span>
No observant person, however, experiences trouble
in marching through the Brazilian forest, and if not
hindered by impossible followers it would be quite
easy to march long distances daily in any part of the
forest without much inconvenience.</p>

<p>This statement only applies to the actual marching,
and does not at all mean that you had not to go through
severe sufferings and endless trials of other kinds.
Unless you were careful where you were sitting, you
found yourself spiked by thorns of great length which
were strewn all over the forest hidden under the thick
carpet of discarded foliage from the trees. Not only
that, but the moment you sat down your body was
simply invaded by swarms of ants of all sizes and
degrees of viciousness, which proceeded to bite you all
over with considerable vigour. There were not many
mosquitoes where the forest was dense, but there were
millions&mdash;in fact, milliards&mdash;of bees, which rendered
your life absolutely unbearable, as they clung to your
face, hands and clothes. Fortunately, they did not
sting, but clinging with their claws upon your skin
they produced such an irritation that you were nearly
driven mad by it.</p>

<p>Then there were fetid bugs of huge size, the sickening
odour of which when they touched you had quite
a nauseating effect. They seemed to have a particular
fondness for settling upon your lips or entering your
mouth. When by mishap you swallowed them, their
taste was something too appalling. Once or twice
while I was eating I had the misfortune to crack
one or two under my teeth. I had the bad taste of
them in my mouth for hours after.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-287" id="Pg_2-287"></a>[<a href="images/2-287.png">287</a>]</span>
When we halted for lunch my men were in a shocking
condition. I could not quite understand what had
happened. Most of them seemed to suffer from violent
internal inflammation accompanied by high fever.</p>

<p>In order to make things as easy as possible for them
I once more rearranged the loads that afternoon,
abandoning six hundred rifle cartridges, several tins of
hyposulphite of soda, other chemicals, all the developing
trays, etc., for my photographic work, and a
number of valuable trinkets I had collected. Much to
my sorrow I had also to abandon the geological collection,
which was too heavy to be carried any farther.
Then I had to abandon all the books which were
necessary for working out my astronomical observations,
such as Norrie's <i>Navigation</i> and <i>The Nautical Almanac</i>,
and all possible articles which were not absolutely
necessary.</p>

<p>After I had gone to the great trouble of unpacking
everything in order to make the loads lighter, I was
surprised to discover, a few minutes later, that the
men had appropriated most of the stuff and shoved
it back in their loads&mdash;in order, perhaps, to sell it
when they got to Manaos.</p>

<p>I said nothing, as it suited me very well. I should
have gladly repurchased the things from them on the
way. One man opened a tin of powdered hyposulphite
and, believing it to be powdered sugar, proceeded to
pour it down his throat. Had I the bad habit of
making puns, I should say that I just saved him in
time from being "fixed" for good. As it was he
swallowed some, and became very ill indeed for some
hours.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-288" id="Pg_2-288"></a>[<a href="images/2-288.png">288</a>]</span>
We luckily killed a big <i>mutum</i> and two monkeys
before leaving that camp, but my men were so ill that
they left them on the ground, saying they had not the
strength to carry them so that we might eat them
for dinner. Well knowing what was in store for us, I
proceeded to carry the huge bird (much larger than
a big turkey) and one of the monkeys (as big as a
child three years old) upon my shoulders.</p>

<p>It was all I could do to struggle along under the
heavy load, as I already carried upon my person some
24 lb. in weight of gold, silver, other moneys, and
instruments, while on my shoulders hung a weight of
some 40 lb. Add to that the big bird and the monkey,
and altogether the weight was certainly not less than
90 lb. I was simply smothered under it.</p>

<p>We suffered a good deal that day from lack of
water and from the intense heat. There seemed to
be no air in the forest, and our breathing was heavy.
Each time a man fell down and refused to go on I
had to put down my load, go to his assistance and
persuade him to get up again. It was a most trying
experience.</p>

<p>After going some eight hours without finding a
drop of water, our throats absolutely parched with
thirst, we luckily came upon some <i>solveira</i> trees, which,
when incised, exuded most excellent milk&mdash;only, of
course, it dropped down tantalizingly slowly, while we
were cruelly thirsty, especially my men in their feverish
state. It was curious to see them all clinging to the
tree with their mouths applied to the wounds in order
to suck the milk.</p>

<hr />
<p>Some way farther on we came across some rubber<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-289" id="Pg_2-289"></a>[<a href="images/2-289.png">289</a>]</span>
trees&mdash;which fact made us joyful, as we knew water
would then be near. In fact, a kilometre beyond,
water of a deep reddish yellow colour was found in a
streamlet 10 m. wide, flowing north.</p>

<p>We halted on the western bank. We had been
cutting through the forest the entire day. My men
were simply exhausted. I, too, was glad when I put
down the bird and the monkey&mdash;particularly as they
had a pungent odour, quite typical of wild animals
of Brazil, which affected my nose for some hours
afterwards. Also they were covered with parasites,
which caused violent itching on my neck and shoulders,
on which they had been resting.</p>

<p>I had marched all the time, compass in hand, next
to the man who with the large knife opened the way
through the forest. We had travelled all day&mdash;cutting,
cutting all the time&mdash;and by the evening we had
gone about 10 kil.&mdash;that is to say, at the rate of a
little over 1 kil. an hour.</p>

<p>The yellow water of the stream&mdash;it looked just like
strong tea, and tasted of everything in the world
except water&mdash;had not a beneficial effect upon my
men. For some reason of their own the men, who
seldom took a bath in the clean rivers, insisted on
bathing in those coloured waters, which, I might also
add, were just then almost stagnant in that particular
section of the stream.</p>

<p>Personally, I had taken out a large cup full of
water before they had gone to bathe, and avoided
drinking again; but my men drank that water, made
dirtier by their immersion and the use of soap&mdash;my
soap, too!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-290" id="Pg_2-290"></a>[<a href="images/2-290.png">290</a>]</span>
The next morning all had excruciating headaches.
Their legs dangled, and they did not seem to be able
to stand on them. Only the Indian&mdash;Miguel&mdash;seemed
to have any strength left. He was a nasty-looking
individual, always sulky and pensive as if under some
great weight upon his conscience. Miguel and I walked
in front, he with a big knife opening the way in the
forest for the others to come behind.</p>

<p>Just before leaving camp on September 1st I had
gone some distance up the yellow stream in order to
get a last drink in case we found no other water that
day. The Indian, who was supposed to know the
forest well, knew nothing whatever, and always misled
me whenever I asked for information.</p>

<p>A few minutes after we had left, I was seized with
violent shivers, my teeth chattered, and I felt quite
as frozen as if I had suddenly dropped in the Arctic
regions. Evidently I had been poisoned by the water.
I collapsed under my load, and for some moments I
could not get up again. Although I had spent all my
time and energy helping everybody else to get up
when in difficulty, not one of my men came near me
to unfasten the loads from my shoulders or help me
to get up on my legs again. They merely squatted a
little way off when they saw that I had collapsed, and
proceeded to roll up their cigarettes and smoke.</p>

<p>True, I did not let my men suspect that I was very
ill. After a few minutes I struggled up once more
under my heavy load and asked the men to come
along. I had been seized with such a violent attack
of fever that my strength seemed to have vanished all
of a sudden, my limbs quivering in a most alarming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-291" id="Pg_2-291"></a>[<a href="images/2-291.png">291</a>]</span>
way. I carried a clinical thermometer on my person.
My temperature was 104&deg; F. From ten o'clock in the
morning until three in the afternoon the attack of
fever was so acute that several times I fell down. My
men, who were in a pitiable condition that day, collapsed,
now one, now another, although their loads
were less than half the weight of mine, each man carrying
about 40 lb. We marched until four o'clock that
afternoon, but only covered a distance of 6 kil. in
that entire day. Two of the men had abandoned their
loads altogether, as they could not carry them any
farther. What vexed me considerably was that they
had discarded my valuable things in preference to
leaving the great weight of rubbish of their own
which they insisted on carrying, such as looking-glasses,
combs, brushes, a number of old clothes in
shreds, and the heavy hammocks, which weighed not
less than 20 lb. each.</p>

<p>We found water in a streamlet which formed a
marsh. There my men insisted on making camp.
It was a most unhealthy spot. Ill as I was, I endeavoured
to induce them to come on a little farther
and see if we could improve on that halting-place.
Miguel, the Indian, who had slightly scratched his
finger, now refused to cut the <i>picada</i> any longer, as he
said the pain was intense. It was only by giving him
a present of money that I had succeeded in leading
the man on until we reached the marsh.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the man X, who was the champion
rascal of the crowd, proved himself that day to
be the best of the whole lot. He even went back with
me to try and recover some of the most important<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-292" id="Pg_2-292"></a>[<a href="images/2-292.png">292</a>]</span>
things from the loads which the men had abandoned
some 2 kil. before we had made our camp.</p>

<p>As we stumbled along we could not even lean
against the trees to have a little rest, as most of them
had thousands of horizontal thorns of great length
sticking out all around them. Innumerable thorns
were upon the ground. Our feet were full of them. I
looked all the time where I was putting my feet, but
sometimes the thorns were hidden under masses of
dried foliage, and they were so long and so strong that
they went clean through the sides of my shoes.</p>

<p>The last blow came to me that evening, when my
men informed me that we had no food whatever left.
All that remained of our three months' provisions were
six tins of sardines and one tin of anchovies. That was
all. My men made no secret of having thrown away
everything as we came along. The sugar, for which
they had a perfect craving, they had eaten, consuming
in the last two days the entire supply of 30 lb.,
which had remained until then. It was then that I
understood the cause of the internal inflammation from
which they all suffered. They were greatly excited,
and demanded the balance of their money, not wishing
to come on any more; they wanted to fall back on
the River Tapajoz and go home. There was a riot.
They threatened to shoot me if I insisted on their
coming on.</p>

<p>Just then a big black monkey appeared upon a
tree, inquisitively watching our doings. The man X
shot it. A moment later a big <i>jaho</i> was brought down,
also by the man X, who was the best shot of the party.
My men were never too ill to eat. They immediately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-293" id="Pg_2-293"></a>[<a href="images/2-293.png">293</a>]</span>
proceeded to skin the poor monkey and pluck the
feathers from the bird, in order to prepare a hearty
meal. But they complained that they had no <i>feij&atilde;o</i>,
and no coffee after their dinner. When we started a
few days before we had a supply of 40 lb. of coffee.</p>

<p>Feasting on the meat did not seem to be a good
remedy for internal inflammation and fever. The next
morning my men were really in a precarious condition.
I saw that it was out of the question for them to
continue. Personally, I would certainly not go back.
I came to an understanding with them that I would
leave sufficient ammunition for them to shoot with, as
there seemed to be plenty of game in that particular part
of the forest. We would divide equally what provisions
we had&mdash;that is to say, three tins of sardines for each
party. I would also give them sufficient money for
one of them, or two, to fall back on the river and
purchase provisions for the entire party. I made them
promise that they should remain in charge of my
baggage, most of which I would leave with them at
that spot, while I, with two men, would go right across
the forest as far as the Madeira River, where I would
endeavour to get fresh men and new provisions.</p>

<p>The men agreed to this. As I could not trust any of
them, I took the precaution to take along with me all my
notebooks and the maps I had made of the entire region
we had crossed, four hundred glass negatives which
I had taken and developed, a number of unexposed
plates, a small camera, my chronometer, one aneroid,
a sextant, a prismatic compass, one other compass, and
a number of other things which were absolutely necessary.
The rest of the baggage I left at that spot. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-294" id="Pg_2-294"></a>[<a href="images/2-294.png">294</a>]</span>
begged the men to take special care of the packages.
All I asked of them was to prop them up on stones so
that the termites and ants should not destroy my possessions,
and to make a shed with palm leaves so as
to protect the packages as much as possible from the
rain. The men promised to do all this faithfully. We
drew lots as to who were to be the two to accompany
me on the difficult errand across the virgin forest.
Fate selected Filippe the negro and Benedicto, both
terribly ill.</p>

<p>We had no idea whatever what the distance would
be between that point and the Madeira River. It
might take us a few days to get there; it might take us
some months. All the provisions we of the advance
party should have to depend upon were the three tins
of sardines and the tin of anchovies&mdash;the latter had
remained in our possession when we tossed up as to
which of the two parties should have it. The Indian
Miguel was induced at the last moment to come also,
and with him came the carrier his friend.</p>

<p>Early on September 2nd I was ready to start, and
roused poor Filippe and Benedicto, who were in a
shocking state. Without a word of farewell from the
men we left behind, and for whom we were about to
sacrifice our lives perhaps, we started on our dangerous
mission. The Indian Miguel and myself walked in
front, cutting the way all the time, while I held my
compass in hand so as to keep the correct direction
west. Considering all, we marched fairly well.</p>

<p>It was curious to note how difficult it was for men
to travel in a straight line while cutting a way through
the forest. I noticed that the Indian, when cutting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-295" id="Pg_2-295"></a>[<a href="images/2-295.png">295</a>]</span>
his way through, using the knife in his right hand,
would gradually veer to the right, so that if you let him
go long enough he would describe a regular circle and
come back to his original starting-point. If he cut
the way with the left hand, the tendency would be to
keep to the left all the time until he had described a
circle that way. That was not characteristic of that
man only, but of nearly all the men I met in Brazil
when making a <i>picada</i>. It was therefore necessary to
keep constant watch with the compass so that the
deviation should be as small as possible during the
march.</p>

<p>We had gone but a short distance from camp when
we came to a streamlet of the most delicious water. I
had suffered a great deal from thirst the day before.
We had been so poisoned by the yellow water of the
stream that I did not like to try more experiments at
the marsh where my men insisted on making camp.
So that now I really enjoyed a good drink of the limpid
water. That day we found too much water. On
going 1 kil. farther, about 4 kil. from camp, we found
another wider and equally delicious streamlet, 2 m.
wide. All the streams we met flowed in a northerly
direction.</p>

<p>We walked and walked the entire day, until 6 p.m.,
covering a distance of 26 kil. The Indian Miguel
worried me the whole day, saying that cutting the
<i>picada</i> was heavy work and he could not go on, as his
finger was hurting him, and the pay he received&mdash;&pound;1
sterling a day&mdash;was too small for the work he had to
do. I had to keep constant watch on him, as he was
a man of a slippery nature, and I did not know what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-296" id="Pg_2-296"></a>[<a href="images/2-296.png">296</a>]</span>
he might do from one moment to another. Also he
said we were simply committing suicide by trying to go
through the virgin forest, as we should meet thousands
of Indians who would attack us, and we had no chance
of escape. I needed this man and his companion to
carry my sextant and the unexposed photographic
plates, some two hundred of them, which were of considerable
weight.</p>

<p>That night, when we made camp, Miguel shot a fine
<i>jac&uacute;</i> (<i>Penelope cristata</i>), and we had a meal. Soon
after a regular downpour came upon us, making us feel
most uncomfortable. At about eight o'clock, however,
the rain stopped. With a great deal of trouble we
were able to light a fire, while the wet leaves of the
trees kept on dropping water on us and making a
peculiar rustling noise on the carpet of dead foliage on
the ground.</p>

<p>By the light of that fire a weird and almost tragic
scene took place. Miguel came up to me, and said in a
dramatic tone that for the sake of his wife and children
I must let him go back, as we were marching to sure
death. If I did not let him go back ... here he
took his forehead between his hands&mdash;"God help me!"
he said, and he burst into tears. He said he did not
wish for his pay, as he had not fulfilled his contract.
Whatever he had on his person he was willing to give
me if I would only let him go back. I said I wished
him to keep all his possessions, and as he did not wish
to go along with me I would certainly let him go back
the next morning. He would then also receive the
pay according to the time he had been with me.
Miguel went back near the fire, where he cried for some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-297" id="Pg_2-297"></a>[<a href="images/2-297.png">297</a>]</span>
time. Accustomed to deal with Brazilians, I perceived
that Miguel thought my promises too good to be true.</p>

<p>When leaving the last camp I had improvised for
myself a kind of hammock with some straps and a
waterproof canvas sheet which I had cut out of one
of my tents. I was lying in that hammock thinking,
when I saw Miguel get up, and, screening his eyes with
his hand, look fixedly my way. I pretended to be
asleep.</p>

<p>Miguel&mdash;who, by the way, was a Christian&mdash;took
the dagger from his waist and walking to a large tree
scratched a cross upon its bark. Then, sticking the
knife with force into the tree, he clasped his hands over
its handle, and bent his head over it, muttering some
prayers. Twice&mdash;perhaps thinking he was being observed&mdash;he
turned round towards me, and when he
did so the expression on his face, lighted by the flickering
flame, was really ghastly.</p>

<p>He prayed for some ten minutes, then, with the
dagger in his hand, he walked cautiously towards my
hammock. He was within 3 metres of me when I jumped
up, seizing Filippe's rifle, which I had placed by my
side in the hammock. With the butt I struck the
Indian a violent blow in the chest.</p>

<p>He stumbled back, dropped his knife and went down
on his knees touching my feet with his trembling
hands and begging my pardon. Again came more
sobs and tears; again more entreaties to be discharged.
I got up and confiscated his rifle and all his cartridges,
as well as the knife, then sent him to his hammock
to sleep. The next morning I would see what I could
do.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-298" id="Pg_2-298"></a>[<a href="images/2-298.png">298</a>]</span>
I saw clearly that it was no use taking on a man
like that, who added to my other trials somewhat of a
mental strain. The next morning, before sunrise, we
were up again. I gave Miguel and his friend their full
salaries up to date and sent them back. I handed him
his rifle and cartridges, which were his own possessions,
but I kept the knife as a memento.</p>

<p>Even when treating men generously in Brazil you
had always to beware of treachery. I told Miguel and
his friend to walk straight ahead and not turn round.
I warned Miguel not to unsling his rifle from his shoulders
until he had walked half a league. If he did
while still in sight of me I would put a bullet through
him. I said it and I meant it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> departure of those two men added much to our
troubles. I had to abandon at that spot all the
unused photographic plates, my sextant and a large
prismatic compass, half the supply of cartridges we
had taken with us, a pair of extra shoes, and a number
of other things. With our reduced loads we made an
early start, Filippe that day behaving very bravely.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said he; "if all the others are
afraid, I am not. I will follow you anywhere. After
all, nothing can happen to us worse than death. You
have always behaved kindly to me, and I will never
abandon you."</p>

<p>Both Filippe and Benedicto were still poorly, but
the violent exertion of the previous day had done
them good and their condition seemed to have slightly
improved.</p>

<p>We started once more across the virgin forest,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-300" id="Pg_2-300"></a>[<a href="images/2-300.png">300</a>]</span>
directing our steps due west. Filippe this time undertook
to open the <i>picada</i>, while I, compass in hand,
marched directly behind him, Benedicto following me.
Filippe, who was unaccustomed to go through the
forest, was even worse than Miguel for keeping the
correct direction. If I had let him go, he would have
described circle after circle upon himself instead of
going in a straight line.</p>

<p>From that point our march across the forest became
tragic. Perhaps I can do nothing better than reproduce
almost word by word the entries in my diary.</p>

<p>We ate that morning what little there remained
of the <i>mutum</i> we had shot the previous evening. Little
we knew then that we were not to taste fresh meat
again for nearly a month from that date.</p>

<p>During September 3rd we made fairly good progress,
cutting our way through incessantly. We went
that day 20 kil. We had no lunch, and it was only
in the evening that we opened the last of the three small
boxes of sardines, our entire dinner consisting of
three and a half sardines each.</p>

<p>On September 4th we were confronted, soon after
our departure, with a mountainous country with
deep ravines and furrows, most trying for us owing to
their steepness. We went over five ranges of hills from
100 to 300 ft. in height, and we crossed five streamlets
in the depressions between those successive ranges.</p>

<p>Filippe was again suffering greatly from an attack
of fever, and I had to support him all the time, as
he had the greatest difficulty in walking. Benedicto
had that day been entrusted with the big knife for
cutting the <i>picada</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-301" id="Pg_2-301"></a>[<a href="images/2-301.png">301</a>]</span>
We went some 20 kil. that day, with nothing
whatever to eat, as we had already finished the three
boxes of sardines, and I was reserving the box of
anchovies for the moment when we could stand hunger
no longer.</p>

<p>On September 5th we had another very terrible
march over broken country, hilly for a good portion
of the distance, but quite level in some parts.</p>

<p>The man Benedicto, who was a great eater, now
collapsed altogether, saying that he could no longer
carry his load and could not go on any farther without
food.</p>

<p>The entire day our eyes had roamed in all directions,
trying to discover some wild fruit which was edible,
or some animal we might shoot, but there was the
silence of death all around us. Not a branch, not a
leaf was moved by a living thing; no fruit of any
kind was to be seen anywhere.</p>

<p>Our appetite was keen, and it certainly had one
good effect&mdash;it stopped Filippe's fever and, in fact,
cured it altogether.</p>

<p>The two men were tormenting me the whole day,
saying they had no faith in the compass: how could
a brass box&mdash;that is what they called it&mdash;tell us where
we could find <i>feij&atilde;o</i>? It was beyond them to understand
it. They bemoaned themselves incessantly,
swearing at the day they had been persuaded to come
along with me and leave their happy homes in order
to die of starvation in the forest with a mad Englishman!
And why did we go across the forest at all,
where there was no trail, when we could have gone
down by the river on a trading boat?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-302" id="Pg_2-302"></a>[<a href="images/2-302.png">302</a>]</span>
On September 6th it was all I could do to wake
up my men. When they did wake, they would not
get up, for they said the only object in getting up
was to eat, and as there was nothing to eat there was
no use in getting up. They wanted to remain there
and die.</p>

<p>I had to use a great deal of gentle persuasion,
and even told them a big story&mdash;that my <i>agulha</i> or
needle (the compass) was telling me that morning
that there was plenty of <i>feij&atilde;o</i> ahead of us.</p>

<p>We struggled on kilometre after kilometre, one or
another of us collapsing under our loads every few
hundred metres. We went over very hilly country,
crossing eight hill ranges that day with steep ravines
between. In fact, all that country must once have
been a low tableland which had been fissured and
then eroded by water, leaving large cracks. At the
bottom of each we found brooks and streamlets
of delicious water. Of the eight rivulets found that
day one only was fairly large. It fell in little cascades
over rock. We could see no fish in its waters.</p>

<p>The forest was fairly clean underneath, and we
had no great difficulty in getting through, a cut every
now and then with the knife being sufficient to make
a passage for us. I had by that time entirely given
up the idea of opening a regular <i>picada</i>, over which
I could eventually take the men and baggage I had left
behind.</p>

<p>We found that day a palm with a bunch of small
nuts which Benedicto called <i>coco do matto</i>; he said
they were delicious to eat, so we proceeded to cut
down the tall palm tree. When we came to split<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-303" id="Pg_2-303"></a>[<a href="images/2-303.png">303</a>]</span>
open the small <i>cocos</i> our disappointment was great,
for they merely contained water. There was nothing
whatever to eat inside the hard shells. We spent
some two hours that evening cracking the <i>cocos</i>&mdash;some
two hundred of them&mdash;each nut about the size of a
cherry. They were extremely hard to crack, and
our expectant eyes were disappointed two hundred
times in succession as we opened every one and found
nothing whatever to eat in them.</p>

<p>We were beginning to feel extremely weak, with
a continuous feeling of emptiness in our insides.
Personally, I felt no actual pain. The mental strain,
perhaps, was the most trying thing for me, for I had
no idea when we might find food. I was beginning
to feel more than ever the responsibility of taking
those poor fellows there to suffer for my sake. On
their side they certainly never let one moment go
by during the day or night without reminding me of
the fact.</p>

<p>On September 7th I had the greatest difficulty
in getting the men out of their hammocks. They
were so exhausted that I could not rouse them. We
had had a terrific storm during the night, which had
added misery to our other sufferings. Innumerable
ants were now causing us a lot of damage. Filippe's
coat, which had dropped out of his hammock, was
found in the morning entirely destroyed. Those
miniature demons also cut the string to which I had
suspended my shoes in mid-air, and no sooner had
they fallen to the ground than the ants started on
their mischievous work. When I woke up in the
morning all that remained of my shoes were the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-304" id="Pg_2-304"></a>[<a href="images/2-304.png">304</a>]</span>
two leather soles, the upper part having been completely
destroyed.</p>

<p>Going through the forest, where thorns of all
sizes were innumerable, another torture was now
in store for me. With pieces of string I turned the
soles of the shoes into primitive sandals; but when
I started on the march I found that they hurt me
much more than if I walked barefooted. After
marching a couple of kilometres, my renovated foot-gear
hurt me so much in going up and down the
steep ravines that I took off the sandals altogether
and flung them away.</p>

<p>That day we went over eleven successive hill
ranges and crossed as many little streamlets between
them. My men were terribly downhearted. We had with
us a Mauser and two hundred cartridges, but although
we did nothing all day long but look for something
to kill we never heard a sound of a living animal. Only
one day at the beginning of our fast did I see a big
<i>mutum</i>&mdash;larger than a big turkey. The bird had never
seen a human being, and sat placidly perched on the
branch of a tree, looking at us with curiosity, singing
gaily. I tried to fire with the Mauser at the bird,
which was only about seven or eight metres away,
but cartridge after cartridge missed fire. I certainly
spent not less than twenty minutes constantly replenishing
the magazine, and not a single cartridge went
off. They had evidently absorbed so much moisture
on our many accidents in the river and in the heavy
rain-storms we had had of late, that they had become
useless.</p>

<p>While I was pointing the gun the bird apparently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-305" id="Pg_2-305"></a>[<a href="images/2-305.png">305</a>]</span>
took the greatest interest in my doings, looked at
me, stooping down gracefully each time that the
rifle missed fire, singing dainty notes almost as if it
were laughing at me. The funny part of it all was
that we eventually had to go away disappointed,
leaving the bird perched on that very same branch.</p>

<p>As the days went by and we could find nothing
to eat, my two men lost their courage entirely. They
now refused to suffer any longer. They said they
had not the strength to go back, so they wanted to
lie down and die. Many times a day did I have to
lift them up again and persuade them gently to come
on another few hundred metres or so. Perhaps then
we might find the great river Madeira, where we should
certainly meet traders from whom we could get food.</p>

<p>Filippe the negro was a great smoker. He had
brought some tobacco with him, and he had so far
smoked all the time. He said that as long as he had
a cigarette in his mouth he did not feel the pangs of
hunger quite so much.</p>

<p>Since my return to civilization I have been constantly
told by smokers that if I had been a smoker
too I might have suffered less than I did. Now let
me tell you what happened to smoker Filippe when
his tobacco came to an end on that painful march.
Filippe became a raving lunatic, and in a fit of passion
was about to stick right through his heart the large
knife with which we cut our way through the forest.
I had quite a struggle in order to get the knife away
from him, and an additional strain was placed upon
my mind by keeping a constant watch on the knife
so that it could not be used for suicidal purposes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-306" id="Pg_2-306"></a>[<a href="images/2-306.png">306</a>]</span>
Poor Benedicto, who was of a less violent nature,
from morning to night implored to be killed. The
two together moaned and groaned incessantly, and
accused me a hundred times a day of taking them
there on purpose to die. They certainly made me
feel the full and heavy weight of our tragic position.
The mental strain of leading along those two poor
fellows was indeed much more trying to me than the
actual lack of food.</p>

<p>In order to save as much as possible of the baggage
we carried, I promised Filippe and Benedicto a considerable
present of money if they were able to take
the stuff until we reached the Madeira River.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon of September 7th, as we
were on a high point above the last range of hills
met that day, a large panorama opened before us,
which we could just see between the trees and foliage
of the forest.</p>

<p>To obtain a full view of the scenery it was necessary
to climb up a tree. I knew well that we could not
yet have reached the river we were looking for, but
perhaps we were not far from some large tributary
of the Madeira, such as the Secundury.</p>

<p>Climbing up trees in the Brazilian forest was
easier said than done, even when you possessed your
full strength. So many were the ants of all sizes
which attacked you with fury the moment you embraced
the tree, that it was not easy to get up more
than a few feet.</p>

<p>When we drew lots as to whom of us should climb
the tree, Benedicto was the one selected by fate.
Benedicto was certainly born under an unlucky star;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-307" id="Pg_2-307"></a>[<a href="images/2-307.png">307</a>]</span>
when anything nasty or unpleasant happened to
anybody it was always to poor Benedicto. After a
lot of pressing he proceeded to go up the tree, uttering
piercing yells as every moment great <i>sauba</i> ants
bit his arms, legs or body. He was brave enough,
and slowly continued his way up until he reached
a height of some 30 ft. above the ground, from which
eminence he gave us the interesting news that there
were some high hills standing before us to the west, while
to the north-west was a great flat surface covered by
dense forest.</p>

<p>No sooner had Benedicto supplied us with this
information from his high point of vantage than we
heard an agonising yell and saw him spread flat on
the ground, having made a record descent.</p>

<p>Filippe and I, although suffering considerably,
were in fits of laughter at Benedicto, who did not
laugh at all, but pawed himself all over, saying he
must have broken some bones. When I proceeded
to examine him I found upon his body over a hundred
<i>sauba</i> ants clinging to his skin with their powerful
clippers.</p>

<p>Aching all over, poor Benedicto got up once more.
I put the load upon his back and we resumed our
journey, making a precipitous descent almost <i>&agrave; pic</i>
down the hill side. Our knees were so weak that
we fell many times and rolled down long distances
on that steep incline. At last we got to the bottom,
rejoicing in our hearts that we had no more hills to
climb, as I had made up my mind that I would now
march slightly to the north-west, so as to avoid the
hilly region which Benedicto had discovered to the west.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-308" id="Pg_2-308"></a>[<a href="images/2-308.png">308</a>]</span>
My men had an idea that the great river we were
looking for must be in that plain. For a few hours
they seemed to have regained their courage. We
heard some piercing shrieks, and we at once proceeded
in their direction, as we knew they came from monkeys.
In fact we found an enormously high tree, some 5 ft.
in diameter. Up on its summit some beautiful yellow
fruit stared us in the face. Four tiny monkeys were
busy eating the fruit. Benedicto, who had by that
time become very religious, joined his hands and
offered prayers to the Virgin that the monkeys might
drop some fruit down, but they went on eating while
we gazed at them from below. We tried to fire at them
with the Mauser, but again not a single cartridge went
off. Eventually the monkeys dropped down the empty
shells of the fruit they had eaten. With our ravenous
appetite we rushed for them and with our teeth scraped
off the few grains of sweet substance which remained
attached to the inside of the shells. We waited and
waited under that tree for a long time, Filippe now
joining also in the prayers. Each time a shell
dropped our palates rejoiced for a few moments at
the infinitesimal taste we got from the discarded
shells. It was out of the question to climb up such
a big tree or to cut it down, as we had no strength left.</p>

<p>We went on until sunset; my men once more
having lost heart. Brazilians lose heart very easily.
At the sight of small hills before them, a steep descent,
or a deep river to cross, they would lie down and
say they wanted to remain there and die. Filippe
and Benedicto did not carry more than 20 lb. each of
my own baggage, but their hammocks weighed some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-309" id="Pg_2-309"></a>[<a href="images/2-309.png">309</a>]</span>
20 lb. each, so that their loads weighed altogether
about 40 lb.</p>

<p>We went on, crossing five more streamlets that
afternoon, of which one, 2 m. wide, had beautifully
limpid water. We nevertheless went on, until eventually
after sunset we had to camp near a stream of
filthy water. We did not mind that so much, because,
contrary to the popular idea that while you are starving
you require a great deal of water, I found that during
those days of starvation both my men and myself
hardly ever touched water at all. Personally I am
accustomed to drink only with my meals, and as I
had no meals at all I never had the slightest wish to
drink. My men, however, who while on the river,
for instance, when we had plenty of food, drank
perhaps twenty times a day from the stream, now
that they were starving only seldom touched the
water, and when they did, only in very small quantities.
I do not suppose that my men during the
entire period of starvation drank on an average more
than a wineglass of water a day. Personally I
know that I never drank more than half a tumbler
or less in the twenty-four hours during that time.
Under normal circumstances I drink about a quart
of water a day. The water, I may say, was plentiful
all the time, and, barring a few occasions, such as
on that particular night, most excellent.</p>

<p>As we had now been four entire days without
eating anything at all, I thought it was high time
to open the valuable tin of anchovies&mdash;the only one
in our possession. We had a terrible disappointment
when I opened the tin. I had purchased it in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-310" id="Pg_2-310"></a>[<a href="images/2-310.png">310</a>]</span>
S. Manoel from Mr. Barretto. To our great distress
we discovered that instead of food it contained merely
some salt and a piece of slate. This was a great blow
to us. The box was a Brazilian counterfeit of a tin
of anchovies. How disheartening to discover the fraud
at so inopportune a moment! I had reserved the
tin until the last as I did not like the look of it
from the outside. We kept the salt&mdash;which was of the
coarsest description.</p>

<p>On September 8th we were slightly more fortunate,
as the country was flatter. I was steering a course
of 290&deg; b.m. (N.W.). I found that farther south we
would have encountered too mountainous a country.</p>

<p>We crossed several streamlets, the largest 3 m.
wide, all of which flowed south. We had no particular
adventure that day, and considering all things,
we marched fairly well&mdash;some 20 kil. Towards the
evening we camped on a hill. When we got there
we were so exhausted that we made our camp on the
summit, although there was no water near.</p>

<p>On September 9th, after marching for half an
hour we arrived at a stream 15 m. wide, which I took
at first to be the river Secundury, a tributary of the
Madeira River. Near the banks of that stream we
found indications that human beings had visited that
spot&mdash;perhaps the Indians we had heard so much about.
The marks we found, however, were, I estimated,
about one year old. Although these signs should
have given us a little courage to go on, we were so
famished and exhausted that my men sat down on
the river bank and would not proceed. By that time
we had got accustomed even to the fierce bites of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-311" id="Pg_2-311"></a>[<a href="images/2-311.png">311</a>]</span>
ants. We had no more strength to defend ourselves.
In vain we strained our eyes all the time in search
of wild fruit. In the river we saw plenty of fish;
we had a fishing-line with us, but no bait whatever
that we could use. There are, of course, no worms
underground where ants are so numerous. We could
not make snares in the river, as it was much too deep.
So we sat with covetous eyes, watching the fish go
by. It was most tantalising, and made us ten times
more hungry than ever to be so near food and not
be able to get it.</p>

<p>It is curious how hunger works on your brain.
I am not at all a glutton, and never think of food
under ordinary circumstances. But while I was
starving I could see before me from morning till night,
in my imagination, all kinds of delicacies&mdash;caviare,
Russian soups, macaroni au gratin, all kinds of refreshing
ice-creams, and plum pudding. Curiously
enough, some days I had a perfect craving for one
particular thing, and would have given anything I
possessed in the world to obtain a morsel of it. The
next day I did not care for that at all, in my imagination,
but wanted something else very badly. The
three things which I mostly craved for while I was
starving were caviare, galantine of chicken, and ice-cream&mdash;the
latter particularly.</p>

<p>People say that with money you can do anything
you like in the world. I had at that time on my person
some &pound;6,000 sterling, of which &pound;4,000 was in actual
cash. If anybody had placed before me a morsel of
any food I would gladly have given the entire sum
to have it. But no, indeed; no such luck! How<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-312" id="Pg_2-312"></a>[<a href="images/2-312.png">312</a>]</span>
many times during those days did I vividly dream of
delightful dinner and supper parties at the Savoy,
the Carlton, or the Ritz, in London, Paris, and New
York! How many times did I think of the delicious
meals I had had when a boy in the home of my dear
father and mother! I could reconstruct in my
imagination all those meals, and thought what an
idiot I was to have come there out of my own free
will to suffer like that. My own dreams were constantly
interrupted by Benedicto and Filippe, who
also had similar dreams of the wonderful meals they
had had in their own houses, and the wonderful ways
in which their <i>feij&atilde;ozinho</i>&mdash;a term of endearment
used by them for their beloved beans&mdash;had been cooked
at home by their sweethearts or their temporary wives.</p>

<p>"Why did we leave our <i>feij&atilde;ozinho</i>"&mdash;and here
they smacked their lips&mdash;"to come and die in this
rotten country?"</p>

<p>All day I heard them talk of <i>feij&atilde;ozinho</i>, <i>feij&atilde;ozinho</i>,
until I was wearied to distraction by that word&mdash;particularly
as, even when starving, I had no desire
whatever to eat the beastly stuff.</p>

<p>The negro Filippe and Benedicto were really brave
in a way. I tried to induce them all the time to
march as much as we could, so as to get somewhere;
but every few moments they sat or fell down, and
much valuable time was wasted.</p>

<p>In a way it was amusing to watch them&mdash;poor
Benedicto particularly, who every few minutes would
take out a little pocket looking-glass to gaze at his
countenance.</p>

<p>"Am I not thin?" he would ask me a dozen times<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-313" id="Pg_2-313"></a>[<a href="images/2-313.png">313</a>]</span>
a day. "I have never been so thin before. If I
had not come with you I should not be so thin. It
is all because we have no food that I am so thin.... If
I had not met you I would never have been so
thin!"&mdash;and so on all day.</p>

<p>I reminded him that when we were travelling
on the river he had complained of baling the water
out of the canoe and preferred to travel overland;
now that we were travelling overland he had a new
complaint to make. It was quite unreasonable. He
was not the only one to get thin; we were all getting
thin.</p>

<p>Benedicto greatly objected to carry the 15 lb.
weight of glass negatives, but he did not mind at all
carrying a lot of useless things of his own, which
weighed an extra 20 lb. or so!</p>

<p>Since my return I have been constantly asked
why, when we were starving, we did not eat the grass
in the forest; why we did not feed on the leaves or
roots of the trees? If we could find no fruit, why
did not we eat monkeys or birds or other animals?
why did not we dig for worms and feed on them?</p>

<p>As I have already stated, there were no worms
in the forest because of the ants, which allow no insect
to be underground near the surface. As for the grass,
it takes no very intelligent person to see that it cannot
exist under the trees of the tropical forest. If a few
blades of grass are to be found on the edge of streamlets
it does not follow that you can eat them. That
grass is usually poisonous. The same may be said
of the leaves and roots of trees, even admitting that
you could reach the former&mdash;which is not the case,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-314" id="Pg_2-314"></a>[<a href="images/2-314.png">314</a>]</span>
as the leaves are usually at a great height upon the
trees, and when you are starving you have not the
strength to climb up. It also follows that where
there is no edible fruit there can be no birds or
monkeys, as animals generally have enough sense not
to settle where there is nothing to eat.</p>

<p>Again, even allowing that some rare trees, the
fruit of which was edible, were to be found, it does
not do to lose sight of the fact that you may be
passing under that tree at the season when it is not
bearing fruit, as fruit-trees, even in tropical countries,
do not always bear fruit at a time to suit the convenience
of the passing traveller.</p>

<p>As I have said, the country we were traversing
was there hilly and rocky, and we were cutting across
the headwaters of numerous tributaries, first of the
Tapajoz River, then of the Madeira River&mdash;the tiny
watercourses, most of them only a few inches wide,
descending in numerous successive small cascades
over rocks&mdash;therefore no fish was to be found. When
we did find it in the big rivers we had no way to
catch it.</p>

<p>It then again follows, concerning the country
between great rivers, that where there is no fish, no
game, no fruit, no vegetables, and no possible way
of cultivating the land, there can be no inhabitants.
That was why the great Brazilian forest in that region
was uninhabited by human beings.</p>

<p>It was rather pathetic, looking back on those
days, to think of the small cooking pot I carried during
that time of starvation in hopes that we might find
something to cook. Its weight was not great, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-315" id="Pg_2-315"></a>[<a href="images/2-315.png">315</a>]</span>
it was a cumbersome thing to carry, as it dangled
about and caught in all the vegetation.</p>

<p>As the days went by and our strength got less
and less every hour, I decided not to cut the forest
any more, but to go through without that extra
exertion. As I could not trust my men with the
big knife, I had to carry it myself, as occasionally it
had to be used&mdash;especially near streams, where the
vegetation was always more or less entangled.</p>

<p>That evening (September 9th) we had halted at
sunset&mdash;simply dead with fatigue and exhaustion.
The <i>sauba</i> ants had cut nearly all the strings of Filippe's
hammock; while he was resting peacefully on it
the remainder of the strings broke, and he had a bad
fall. He was so exhausted that he remained lying
on the ground, swarming all over with ants and
moaning the whole time, having no strength to repair
the hammock.</p>

<p>When Filippe eventually fell into a sound slumber
I had a curious experience in the middle of the night.
I was sleeping in my improvised hammock, when I
felt two paws resting on my body and something
sniffing in my face. When I opened my eyes I found
a jaguar, standing up on its hind paws, staring me
straight in the face. The moment I moved, the
astonished animal, which had evidently never seen a
human being before, leapt away and disappeared.</p>

<p>I find that people have strange ideas about wild
animals. It is far from true that wild beasts are vicious.
I have always found them as gentle as possible. Although
I have seen nearly every wild beast that it is
possible for man to see in the world, I have never once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-316" id="Pg_2-316"></a>[<a href="images/2-316.png">316</a>]</span>
been attacked by them, although on dozens of occasions
I have come into close contact with them. I invariably
found all wild animals&mdash;<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'expect'">except</ins> the African
buffalo&mdash;quite timid and almost gentle, unless, of
course, they have been worried or wounded. These
remarks do not apply to wild animals in captivity.</p>

<p>On September 10th&mdash;that was the seventh day of
our involuntary fast&mdash;we had another dreary march,
again without a morsel of food. My men were so downhearted
that I really thought they would not last much
longer. Hunger was playing on them in a curious
way. They said that they could hear voices all round
them and people firing rifles. I could hear nothing
at all. I well knew that their minds were beginning
to go, and that it was a pure hallucination. Benedicto
and Filippe, who originally were both atheists of an
advanced type, had now become extremely religious,
and were muttering fervent prayers all the time.
They made a vow that if we escaped alive they would
each give &pound;5 sterling out of their pay to have a big
mass celebrated in the first church they saw.</p>

<p>They spoke in a disconnected way, and looked
about in a dazed condition, alternating hysterical
laughter with abundant tears. After Filippe's tobacco
had come to an end he had become most dejected, all
the time wishing to commit suicide.</p>

<p>"What is the use of more suffering?" he exclaimed
fifty times a day. "Let me die quickly, as
I can stand the pain no more!" Then all of a sudden
his eyes would shine, he would prick up his ears,
crying: "We are near people!&mdash;we are near people!
I can hear voices! Let us fire three shots" (the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-317" id="Pg_2-317"></a>[<a href="images/2-317.png">317</a>]</span>
signal all over Central Brazil of an approaching
stranger or of help required), "so that people can
come to our assistance!"</p>

<p>That was much easier said than done, because
none of our cartridges would go off. We had one box
of matches left. We had taken several boxes of
them, but Filippe had used them all in lighting his
cigarettes, and we had only one left, which I guarded
with much care. To please my men we lighted a
big fire, and in it we placed a number of cartridges
so that they should explode. In fact some of them
actually did explode, and my men strained their
ears in order to discover responding sounds. But
no sounds came, although they imagined they could
hear all kinds of noises.</p>

<p>At this place I abandoned the few cartridges we
had, as they were absolutely useless. They were
Mauser cartridges which I had bought in Rio de Janeiro,
and it is quite possible that they were counterfeits.</p>

<p>Taking things all round, my men behaved very
well, but these were moments of the greatest anxiety
for me, and I myself was praying fervently to God
to get us out of that difficulty. My strength was
failing more and more daily, and although I was
suffering no actual pain, yet the weakness was simply
appalling. It was all I could do to stand up on my
legs. What was worse for me was that my head was
still in good working order, and I fully realised our
position all the time.</p>

<p>The country we were travelling over was fairly
hilly, up and down most of the time, over no great
elevations. We passed two large tributaries of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-318" id="Pg_2-318"></a>[<a href="images/2-318.png">318</a>]</span>
main stream we had found before, and a number of
minor ones. The main stream was strewn with fallen
trees, and was not navigable during the dry season.
The erosion of the banks by the water had caused
so many trees to fall down across it that no canoe
could possibly go through.</p>

<p>I noticed in one or two places along the river
traces of human beings having been there some years
before.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we again wasted much energy
in knocking down two palm-trees on the summit of
which were great bunches of <i>coco do matto</i>. Again
we had a bitter disappointment. One after the other
we split the nuts open, but they merely contained
water inside shells that were much harder to crack
than wood. My craving for food was such that
in despair I took two or three <i>sauba</i> ants and
proceeded to eat them. When I ground them under
my teeth their taste was so acidly bitter that it made
me quite ill. Not only that, but one <i>sauba</i> bit my
tongue so badly that it swelled up to a great size,
and remained like that for several days. The entire
genus of the Sauba (<i>&#338;codonia cephalotes</i>) ant is typical
of tropical South America. The largest Sauba is
about an inch long, and possesses powerful scissor-like
clippers, with which it can destroy any material,
such as leather, cloth, paper or leaves, in a very short
time. Their method of work is to cut up everything
into circles. I remember one day dropping on the
ground a pair of thick gloves. When I went to pick
them up I found them reduced to a heap of innumerable
little discs&mdash;each as large as a sixpenny coin. It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-319" id="Pg_2-319"></a>[<a href="images/2-319.png">319</a>]</span>
with those powerful clippers that the Saubas, having
climbed in swarms up a tree, proceed to despoil it of
its foliage. The work is done in a systematic way,
each ant quickly severing one leaf and carrying it down,
banner-like, vertically above its head, tightly held
between its strong mandibles.</p>

<p>It is this habit of the Saubas which has brought
upon them the Brazilian name of <i>Carregadores</i>, or
carriers. One sees everywhere in that country long
processions of those destructive insects, each individual
marching along quickly with its green
vegetable banner, sometimes eight or ten times its
own size and weight. In many cases the Saubas
working aloft cut the leaves and drop them on the
ground, where other carriers are waiting to convey
them away. So numerous are the Saubas that in the
forest one can hear distinctly the incessant rustling
sound of their clippers at work. The Saubas use
the leaves in order to construct thatched waterproof
roofs over the domes and turrets at the entrances of
their extensive subterranean galleries, which would
otherwise become flooded during the torrential rains
prevalent in those latitudes. The roofs are constructed
with wonderful skill, each leaf being held in its place
by granules of earth. The galleries, of immense
length and much ramified, are often as much as 10
to 15 cm. in diameter. The entrances to them
are usually kept blocked, and are only opened when
necessary. Above ground the Saubas make wonderful
wide roads, thousands of which can be seen everywhere
in the forest, and upon which endless processions go
by day and night. The workers of the Saubas can be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-320" id="Pg_2-320"></a>[<a href="images/2-320.png">320</a>]</span>
divided into three orders not very clearly defined, as
units of intermediate grades are constantly met. The
largest of those workers possess extraordinarily massive,
double-humped heads, highly polished in the case of
members which are visible on the surface, and dull
and hairy in the giant fellows which spend their lives
within the subterranean passages. These hairy Saubas
display a single frontal eye&mdash;not found in any of the
other Saubas, and, as far as I know, in no other kind
of ant. They never come to the surface except when
attacks are made upon the galleries. Great excitement
is shown in the colonies when the winged ants, of
extra large size&mdash;especially the females&mdash;start out on
their errand of propagating the race.</p>

<p>The workers with polished heads&mdash;fierce-looking
brutes&mdash;do very little actual work, but seem to be
the superiors and protectors of the smaller workers.
In every case the body of all orders of Saubas is solidly
built, with the thorax and head protected by spikes.</p>

<p>Much as I disliked the Saubas for the endless
trouble and suffering they inflicted upon me, I could
not help admiring their marvellous industry and
energy. No agriculture is possible where the Saubas
are to be found, and even where they do not exist
in Central Brazil, if agriculture were started they
would soon invade the territory and destroy everything
in a short time. Foreign plants do not escape. No
way has been found yet of extirpating them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> September 11th we had another terrible march,
the forest being very dense and much entangled along
the stream. We had great trouble in getting through,
as there were many palms and ferns, and we had no
more strength to cut down our way. We came to
a big tree, which was hollow inside up to a great
height, and round which were millions of bees.</p>

<p>Benedicto, who was a great connoisseur in such
matters, said that high up inside the tree there must
be honey. The bees round that tree were unfortunately
stinging bees. We drew lots as to who should go
inside the tree to get the honey. It fell to Benedicto.
We took off most of our clothes and wrapped up his
head and legs so that he might proceed to the attack.
The job was not an easy one, for in the first reconnaissance
he made with his head inside the tree he
discovered that the honey must be not less than 20 ft.
above the ground, and it was necessary to climb up
to that height inside the tree before he could get it.
In order to hasten matters&mdash;as Benedicto was reluctant
in carrying out the job&mdash;I tried my hand at it, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-322" id="Pg_2-322"></a>[<a href="images/2-322.png">322</a>]</span>
I was stung badly by hundreds of bees behind my
head, on my eyelids, on my arms and legs. When I
came out of the tree I was simply covered with angry
bees, which stung me all over. So I told Benedicto
that, as Fate had called upon him to do the work, he
had better do it.</p>

<p>Benedicto was certainly very plucky that day. All
of a sudden he dashed inside the tree and proceeded
to climb up. We heard wild screams for some minutes;
evidently the bees were protecting their home well.
While Filippe and I were seated outside, smiling faintly
at poor Benedicto's plight, he reappeared. We hardly
recognized him when he emerged from the tree, so
badly stung and swollen was his face, notwithstanding
the protection he had over it. All he brought back
was a small piece of the honeycomb about as large
as a florin. What little honey there was inside was
quite putrid, but we divided it into three equal parts
and devoured it ravenously, bees and all. A moment
later all three of us were seized with vomiting, so
that the meagre meal was worse than nothing to us.</p>

<p>We were then in a region of innumerable liane,
which hung from the trees and caught our feet and
heads, and wound themselves round us when we tried
to shift them from their position. Nearly all the
trees in that part had long and powerful spikes. Then
near water there were huge palms close together,
the sharp-edged leaves of which cut our hands, faces
and legs as we pushed our way through.</p>

<p>A violent storm broke out in the afternoon. The
rain was torrential, making our march extremely
difficult. It was just like marching under a heavy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-323" id="Pg_2-323"></a>[<a href="images/2-323.png">323</a>]</span>
shower-bath. The rain lasted for some three hours.
We crossed one large stream flowing west into the
Secundury, and also two other good-sized streamlets.</p>

<p>We had a miserable night, drenched as we were
and unable to light a fire, the box of matches having
got wet and the entire forest being soaked by the
torrential storm. During the night another storm
arrived and poured regular buckets of water upon
us.</p>

<p>On September 12th we drowsily got up from our
hammocks in a dejected state. By that time we had
lost all hope of finding food, and no longer took the
trouble to look round for anything to eat. We went
on a few hundred metres at a time, now Benedicto
fainting from exhaustion, then Filippe, then myself.
While one or another was unconscious much time
was wasted. Marching under those conditions was
horrible, as either one or other of us collapsed every
few hundred metres.</p>

<p>Another violent storm broke out, and we all lay
on the ground helpless, the skin of our hands and feet
getting shrivelled up with the moisture.</p>

<p>My feet were much swollen owing to the innumerable
thorns which had got into them while walking
barefooted. It was most painful to march, as I was
not accustomed to walk without shoes.</p>

<p>We went only ten kilometres on September 12th.
We crossed two small rivers and one large, flowing
west and south, evidently into the Secundury.</p>

<p>On September 13th we had another painful march,
my men struggling along, stumbling and falling every
little while. They were dreadfully depressed. Towards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-324" id="Pg_2-324"></a>[<a href="images/2-324.png">324</a>]</span>
the evening we came to a big tree, at the foot of which
we found some discarded shells, such as we had once
seen before, of fruit eaten by monkeys. My men and I
tried to scrape with our teeth some of the sweet substance
which still adhered to the shells. We saw
some of the fruit, which was fit to eat, at a great height
upon the tree, but we had not the strength to climb
up or cut down that enormous tree.</p>

<p>All the visions of good meals which I had had
until then had now vanished altogether on that tenth
day of fasting, and I experienced a sickly feeling in my
inside which gave me an absolute dislike for food of
any kind. My head was beginning to sway, and I
had difficulty in collecting my ideas. My memory
seemed to be gone all of a sudden. I could no longer
remember in what country I was travelling, nor could
I remember anything distinctly. Only some lucid
intervals came every now and then, in which I realised
our tragic position; but those did not last long,
all I could remember being that I must go to the
west. I could not remember why nor where I intended
to come out.</p>

<p>Everything seemed to be against us. We were
there during the height of the rainy season. Towards
sunset rain came down once more in bucketfuls and
lasted the entire night, the water dripping from our
hammocks as it would from a small cascade. We were
soaked, and shivering, although the temperature was
not low. I had my maximum and minimum thermometers
with me, but my exhaustion was such that
I had not the strength to unpack them every night
and morning and set them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-325" id="Pg_2-325"></a>[<a href="images/2-325.png">325</a>]</span>
We crossed two streamlets flowing west. Benedicto
and Filippe were in such a bad way that it was
breaking my heart to look at them. Every time
they fell down in a faint I never knew whether it
was for the last time that they had closed their eyes.
When I felt their hearts with my hand they beat so
faintly that once or twice I really thought they were
dead. That day I myself fainted, and fell with the
left side of my face resting on the ground. When I
recovered consciousness some time later, I touched
my face, which was hurting me, and found that nearly
the whole skin of my cheek had been eaten up by
small ants, the lower lid of the eye having suffered
particularly. A nasty sore remained on my face for
some two months after that experience, the bites of
those ants being very poisonous.</p>

<p>Bad as they were, there is no doubt that to a
great extent we owed our salvation to those terrible
ants. Had it not been for them and the incessant
torture they inflicted on us when we fell down upon
the ground, we should have perhaps lain there and
never got up again.</p>

<p>I offered Benedicto and Filippe a large reward if
they continued marching without abandoning the
precious loads. Brazilians have a great greed for
money, and for it they will do many things which
they would not do otherwise.</p>

<p>On September 14th we made another most painful
march of 20 kil., again up and down high hills, some
as much as 300 ft. above the level land of that country,
and all with steep, indeed, almost vertical, sides,
extremely difficult for us to climb in our exhausted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-326" id="Pg_2-326"></a>[<a href="images/2-326.png">326</a>]</span>
condition. We saw several streamlets flowing west.
When evening came we had before us a high hill, which
we ascended. When we reached the top we just
lay upon the ground like so many corpses, and, ants,
or no ants biting us, we had not the energy to get
up again. Once more did the rain come down in
torrents that night, and to a certain extent washed
the ants from our bodies.</p>

<p>My surprise was really great the next morning
when I woke up. I felt myself fading away fast.
Every time I closed my eyes I expected never to
open them again.</p>

<p>On September 15th we made another trying march,
collapsing under our loads every few hundred metres.
My men were constantly looking for something to eat
in all directions, but could find nothing. Benedicto
and Filippe were now all the time contemplating
suicide. The mental strain of perpetually keeping an
eye on them was great.</p>

<p>We were sitting down, too tired to get up, when
Filippe amazed me considerably by the following
words, which he spoke in a kind of reverie:</p>

<p>"It would be very easy," he said, "now that you
have no more strength yourself, for us two to get
the big knife and cut your throat. We know that
you have a big, big sum of money upon you, and if
we robbed you we would be rich for ever. But we
do not want to do it. It would not be much use
to us, as we could not get out of the forest alone.
I believe we shall all die together, and all that money
will go to waste."</p>

<p>Filippe said this in quite a good-natured manner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-327" id="Pg_2-327"></a>[<a href="images/2-327.png">327</a>]</span>
The two poor fellows were so depressed that one had
to forgive them for anything they said.</p>

<p>As the river seemed to describe a big loop, I had
left it three days before, seeing plainly by the conformation
of the country that we should strike it
again sooner or later. We were marching once more
by compass. My men, who had no faith whatever
in the magnetic needle, were again almost paralysed
with fear that we might not encounter the stream
again. A thousand times a day they accused me of
foolishness in leaving the river, as they said it would
have been better to follow its tortuous course&mdash;notwithstanding
the trouble we had in following it, owing
to the dense vegetation near the water&mdash;rather than
strike once more across country. They were beginning
to lose heart altogether, when I told them I
could see by the vegetation that we were once more
near the water. Anybody accustomed as I am to
marching through the forest could tell easily by the
appearance of the vegetation some miles before actually
getting to a stream.</p>

<p>I reassured my companions, saying that within a
few hours we should certainly meet the "big water"
again. In fact, not more than half an hour afterwards
we suddenly found ourselves once more on the
large stream&mdash;at that point 70 metres wide.</p>

<p>My men were so amazed and delighted that they
embraced me and sobbed over my shoulders for some
time. From that moment their admiration for the
compass was unbounded; they expected me to find
anything with it.</p>

<p>With gladdened hearts we followed the stream<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-328" id="Pg_2-328"></a>[<a href="images/2-328.png">328</a>]</span>
again, Benedicto and Filippe shouting at the top of
their voices for help in case anybody were near. But
they called and called in vain. We listened, but not
a sound could be heard, except perhaps that of a
crashing tree in the forest&mdash;a sound very familiar
when marching across Brazil.</p>

<p>The right bank of the Secundury river was high,
not less than from 30 to 40 ft., and extremely steep,
formed of alluvial deposits with a thick surface layer
of decayed vegetation, making a soft carpet. Two
small tributary streams had cut deep grooves in the
soft earth. In our weak condition we had the greatest
trouble in going down the almost vertical banks and
climbing up again on the other side.</p>

<p>On September 16th we followed the river once
more, crossing three tributaries, the largest of which
was 4 m. wide. The forest was beautifully clean
underneath, just like a well-kept park. The stems
of the trees were as clean as possible up to a great
height, the foliage forming a regular roof over us
through which little light and only exhausted air
penetrated.</p>

<p>Although we could find nothing whatever to eat,
my men were not so depressed that day, as they
expected to find some living people sooner or later.
I did not like to disappoint them, although the fact
that we could find no signs of human creatures having
recently gone through that region showed me plainly
that we were yet far away from salvation.</p>

<p>Another formidable rainstorm came down upon
us in the morning, the water descending in regular
sheets. We were so exhausted that we did not care<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-329" id="Pg_2-329"></a>[<a href="images/2-329.png">329</a>]</span>
for anything any more. Whether we got wet or
dry was quite immaterial to us.</p>

<p>I was so conscious of my utmost exhaustion that
I felt I could not now last much longer under
that heavy strain. Every fifty or a hundred metres I
collapsed under my load, and had the greatest struggle
to get up on my feet again. Those marches were
most tragic, my men being, if possible, in a worse
condition than me, they, too, collapsing every few
steps. Thus in a day we each collapsed dozens of
times. That was the thirteenth day we had had no
food whatever, barring perhaps a grain of salt from
the fraudulent anchovy tin, which I had preserved
in a piece of paper.</p>

<p>I felt no actual pain, only great emptiness in my
inside, and a curious feeling of nausea, with no wish
whatever to eat or to drink. Although water was
plentiful we hardly touched it at all&mdash;only a few
drops to moisten our feverish lips. That fact interested
me greatly, as it was absolutely contrary to people's
notions of what happens when you are starving. All
I experienced was indescribable exhaustion. I felt
myself gradually extinguishing like a burnt-out lamp.</p>

<p>Benedicto and Filippe had dreadful nightmares
during the night, and occasionally gave frantic yells.
That night Filippe all of a sudden startled us crying
out for help; a moment later he collapsed in a faint.
When he recovered I asked him what was the matter;
he said in a dazed way that there were people all
round us bringing plenty of food to us&mdash;an hallucination
which was soon dispelled when he returned to his
senses.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-330" id="Pg_2-330"></a>[<a href="images/2-330.png">330</a>]</span>
On September 17th we had another painful march
without finding a grain of food to eat. Again we
started our day with a severe thunderstorm, the water
coming down upon us in bucketfuls. Benedicto and
Filippe were fervently praying the Almighty to strike
them down by lightning so as to end the daily torture.</p>

<p>The strain of leading those fellows on was getting
almost too much for me. The greatest gentleness had
to be employed, as an angry word would have finished
them altogether, and they would have laid down to die.</p>

<p>The rain came down in such torrents that day,
and we were so soaked, that we had to halt, we three
huddling together to try and protect ourselves under
the waterproof sheet which I used at night as a
hammock. When we went on I noticed a cut in a
tree which had been made some years before. I soon
discovered the tracks which had been followed by the
person who had made that cut, and soon after I discovered
another mark of a knife upon another rubber
tree. Evidently somebody had been there prospecting.
We followed the ancient track for some distance in
a most winding way&mdash;those marks, I judged, having
been made about four years before.</p>

<p>My men were depressed to the utmost degree
when, on following the track of the stranger, we discovered
the spot on the river where he had evidently
once more got into his canoe and gone. One more
hope of salvation shattered!</p>

<p>Curiously enough, upon that fourteenth day of
starving my strength got up again to a certain extent,
although I still had no wish whatever to eat; but my
head began to swim with a strange sensation as if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-331" id="Pg_2-331"></a>[<a href="images/2-331.png">331</a>]</span>
the trees of the forest were tumbling down upon me.
The impression was so vivid that several times I fell
in trying to avoid what I thought was a tree falling
upon me.</p>

<p>The swaying of my head seemed to get worse and
worse all that day, until the unpleasant sensation of
the forest closing in and overwhelming me became
intolerable.</p>

<p>In the evening we came in for another storm, the
rain being torrential through nearly the entire night.
During the day I had had the optical illusion of
trees falling upon me. During the night I had the
real thing. The upper part of the tree to which I
had tied my hammock came down with a terrific
crash during a heavy gust of wind, and just missed
my head by a few inches. As it was it tore down
my hammock with me inside it, and I received a
bump that I shall not forget in a hurry.</p>

<p>We certainly seemed to have no luck whatever on
that fateful expedition! Aching all over, soaked
right through, water dripping down my hands, nose
and hair like so many little fountains, I proceeded to
tie my hammock to another tree, while poor Filippe
and Benedicto, who had been caught in the foliage
and branches of the falling tree, were trying to disentangle
themselves from their unpleasant position.
The tree had fallen because it had been eaten up
internally by ants. When it came down upon us
they simply swarmed over us, and bit us all over for
all they were worth. I have no wish whatever to
have another such miserable night.</p>

<p>On September 18th we lost the whole morning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-332" id="Pg_2-332"></a>[<a href="images/2-332.png">332</a>]</span>
owing to the torrential rain which continued. We
had not the strength to go on.</p>

<p>Now that Filippe and Benedicto had absolute
faith in my compass, I had again left the river where
it described a big turn toward the south-west, and
it was not until two o'clock that afternoon that I
struck the big stream once more and we followed its
right bank.</p>

<p>To our great delight we came to a small clearing
where some years before <i>mandioca</i> had been cultivated.
We threw down our loads at once and proceeded to
search for roots. To our great joy we found one
small root, about as big as a small carrot. We made
a fire. Oh! the anxiety in lighting up that fire, as
we only had eight matches left, and they had got
damp.</p>

<p>Filippe, who was the expert in striking matches,
was entrusted with the job. Alas! he struck and
struck time after time the first match against the box
until its head was worn off altogether, and no flame
was produced. With some anxiety we watched the
second match having a similar fate.</p>

<p>The men said that the root we had found was of
wild <i>mandioca</i>, and if we ate it raw we should certainly
all die, but if roasted properly over a flame it lost some
of its poisonous qualities. We all had our eyes fixed
on that root, and felt the happiest of mortals, as if
the most expensive banquet had all of a sudden been
placed before us. It was a great relief when Filippe
struck the third match and it actually produced
a flame. We lighted a fire, roasting the valuable
root upon it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-333" id="Pg_2-333"></a>[<a href="images/2-333.png">333</a>]</span>
Benedicto, who was the culinary expert, roasted
the root until it was nearly carbonized, and by the
time he took it out of the flame we had each of us left
for our share a section of its fibrous core not larger
than a well-smoked cigarette stump.</p>

<p>We devoured that luxurious meal in haste. It
tasted as bitter as aloes. No sooner had I eaten it
than I felt extremely ill, my men also experiencing
a similar sensation. Benedicto was the first one to
vomit painfully and cough violently; then came my
turn, then Filippe's. So our first meal was not much
of a success.</p>

<p>The little strength we had seemed now to have
disappeared altogether. We lay helpless upon the
bank of the river, unable to move. Once or twice
Filippe shouted for help, thinking that our voices
might be heard, but no answer ever came to our cries.</p>

<p>Eventually we proceeded once more along the
right bank of the river, when we perceived on the
opposite bank an abandoned hut. The river at that
point was 70 m. wide, from 4 to 5 ft. deep, with a
fairly strong current. We decided to cross over and
see if perhaps by chance some food had been abandoned
in the hut. It was already evening, and we were
so exhausted that we did not dare to cross the stream,
especially as Filippe and Benedicto could not swim.</p>

<p>The next day, September 19th, we proceeded to
ford the stream, having scarcely the strength to keep
erect, especially in the middle of the river with the
water up to our necks. We were carrying our loads
on our heads, so that they should not get wetter than
possible. My negatives were fortunately in air-tight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-334" id="Pg_2-334"></a>[<a href="images/2-334.png">334</a>]</span>
cases, or else they certainly would have been destroyed
altogether on that disastrous march across the forest.</p>

<p>We got safely to the other side. The bank was
very high. A broken-down canoe had been left on
the shore. We worked many hours trying to mend
her so that we could proceed down the river. But
we wasted the entire day, working feverishly for six
or seven hours, trying to stop up great holes as big as
my fist, one sleeve of my coat being used for the
purpose, and replacing a plank at her stern which was
missing.</p>

<p>When we at length summoned our last atom of
strength to launch her, she immediately filled with
water and went to the bottom like a piece of lead.
That was the end of the canoe. We had not the
strength to float her again.</p>

<p>Building a raft was impossible, as no wood was
found that floated. In reconnoitring round the hut,
to our great joy we discovered some <i>caju</i> and some
<i>guyaba</i> trees; also some more roots of <i>mandioca</i> now
become wild.</p>

<p>That was our sixteenth day of fasting, and it
can well be imagined how quickly we devoured what
little unripe fruit was hanging from the trees. Once
more we tried the experiment of cooking the <i>mandioca</i>
roots. We had now only five matches left. It was
curious to note with what care we prepared dried
wood and leaves so that no chance would be lost in
getting a flame. Fortunately the first match struck
did its work well, and we soon had a big fire inside the
hut, on which we roasted the <i>mandioca</i>.</p>

<p>As I have explained elsewhere, the fruit of the <i>caju</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-335" id="Pg_2-335"></a>[<a href="images/2-335.png">335</a>]</span>
has an outward nut which has highly caustic properties,
and is deadly poisonous to eat uncooked but quite
edible when roasted. After eating all the fruit we
kept those nuts and put them on the fire; in the
evening we sat down to what seemed to us a luxuriant
meal.</p>

<p>We had not patience to wait for the <i>caju</i> nuts
to be properly roasted. When I ate them my nose,
lips, tongue and fingers became badly burned by their
caustic juice. No sooner had we eaten that meal
than we all became violently ill. I dropped down
unconscious, rejecting everything and quantities of
blood besides. I must have been unconscious many
hours, after which I slept soundly till the sun was
well up in the sky, when I found myself resting on
the ground with a pool of blood by my side. Poor
Filippe and Benedicto were also in a bad way.</p>

<p>On the front of that hut on a piece of board was
written "El Paraiso" (Paradise), the name of that
place. It was not exactly my idea of Heaven.</p>

<p>Our first meals were worse than no meals at all.
We felt in such a plight that we lay helpless upon the
floor of the hut, quite unable to move, so exhausted
were we. In turning my head around I discovered
ten large demijohns, some 2&frac12; ft. high and about 2 ft.
in diameter, of thick green glass. They were the
usual demijohns&mdash;<i>garaffons</i>, as they are called&mdash;used
all over Brazil for "fire-water." I at once conceived
the idea of using them as floats in the construction
of a raft.</p>

<p>My men grinned contemptuously at the idea when
I mentioned it to them. They said that all was over.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-336" id="Pg_2-336"></a>[<a href="images/2-336.png">336</a>]</span>
It was no use trying to get away. The Almighty
wanted us to die, and we must only lie there and
await our end, which was not far off. Benedicto
struggled to his knees and prayed to the Almighty
and the Virgin, sobbing bitterly all the time.</p>

<p>I struggled up on my feet and proceeded to carry
the big vessels to the river bank, where I intended to
construct the raft. The effort to take each heavy bottle
those few metres seemed almost beyond me in my exhausted
state. At last I proceeded to strip the floor of
the hut, which had been made with split <i>assahy</i> palms
(<i>Euterpe oleracea</i> L.), in order that I might make a
frame to which I could fasten the bottles. With a
great deal of persuasion I got Filippe and Benedicto
to help me. The long pieces of <i>assahy</i> were too heavy
for our purpose, and we had the additional trouble
of splitting each piece into four. It was most
trying work in our worn-out condition. Then we had
to go into the forest and collect some small liane,
so that we could tie the pieces together, as we had no
nails and no rope.</p>

<p>On September 20th, again without food&mdash;for we
had eaten up all the fruit the previous day&mdash;we worked
from morning till night in building the raft. Unfortunately,
Benedicto stumbled against one of the
bottles, which was on the edge of the river; it rolled
down the steep bank and floated quickly down stream,
and we saw it disappear, unable to go and recover it.
So only nine bottles were left.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill2-336.jpg"><img src="images/ill2-336_th.jpg" alt="Raft constructed by the Author in order to navigate the Canuma River with his Two Companions of Starvation." title="Raft constructed by the Author in order to navigate the Canuma River with his Two Companions of Starvation." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Raft constructed by the Author in order to navigate the Canuma River with his Two Companions of Starvation.</p>
<hr />
<p>I made the raft of a triangular shape, with two
parallel diagonal rows of three bottles each at a
distance of 3 ft. apart; then one set of two bottles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-337" id="Pg_2-337"></a>[<a href="images/2-337.png">337</a>]</span>
One single <i>garaffon</i> formed the bow of the raft.
Naturally I stopped up the necks of the bottles, so
that no water should get inside.</p>

<p>While I was constructing the raft I was all the
time wondering whether it would have a sufficient
floating capacity to carry us three men and our baggage.</p>

<p>When the raft was finished we placed two parallel
pieces of <i>assahy</i> from one end to the other, on which
we could sit astride, with our legs dangling in the
water.</p>

<p>The lassitude with which we did our work and
tore down part of the hut in order to build that raft,
our only way of salvation, was too pitiful to watch.
We absolutely had no strength at all. When we
pulled the liane to fasten together the different pieces
of palm wood we were more exhausted than if we
had lifted a weight of 200 lb. As it was, we could
not fasten the pieces of wood properly, and when the
raft was finished it was indeed a shaky affair.</p>

<p>By sunset on September 20th the raft&mdash;strengthened
by sundry knots all over&mdash;was ready to be launched.
I was more proud of her than if I had built a Dreadnought.
There we all sat by the side of her, my men
looking at her in a sceptical way, saying that it was
just as well, perhaps, to try and die drowned instead
of dying of starvation.</p>

<p>We took a last glance around to see if we could
discover some other fruit or something to eat, but
we found nothing. We postponed the launching of
our vessel&mdash;which I named the <i>Victory</i>&mdash;until the
next morning, as had she perchance had an accident
that night&mdash;accidents at night seem so much worse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-338" id="Pg_2-338"></a>[<a href="images/2-338.png">338</a>]</span>
than in the daytime&mdash;it would have been too severe
a blow for us, from which we never could have recovered.</p>

<p>My feet were in such a terrible condition&mdash;so full
of thorns, so swollen with numberless <i>jiggers</i> which
had bored channels under my nails and under the
soles&mdash;that I really felt I could not walk another step.
If that raft did not float I knew that we were lost
for good.</p>

<p>The entire night I could not sleep, speculating on
whether the raft would float or not. As far as I
could judge, she seemed to me to have just capacity
enough to keep afloat with all of us on board.</p>

First Solid Meal&mdash;Its Consequences&mdash;The Canuma and Secundury

Men left behind&mdash;A Strange Mishap&mdash;A Curious Case of Telepathy</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> September 21st my men had a great discussion.
Their courage failed altogether, as they said they
had never before seen a boat of that kind, made of
glass bottles, and that, even allowing that she would
float at all, if we struck a rock where should we be?
They declared that, tired as they were, they preferred
to go on struggling on foot through the forest
rather than get drowned. With his peculiar reasoning,
Benedicto said that it was bad enough to die of starvation,
but to die of starvation and get drowned as
well was too much for him!</p>

<p>It was decided that we should first of all try
whether the raft would bear our weight or not. If
she did, we would sail in her. If she did not, I would
navigate her and they might go on foot.</p>

<p>It was a moment of great excitement and suspense
when we launched the <i>Victory</i>. You should have
seen the faces of Benedicto and Filippe when she
floated on the water as gracefully as a duck. I got
on her, and with a punting pole went half-way across
the river and back again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-340" id="Pg_2-340"></a>[<a href="images/2-340.png">340</a>]</span>
Filippe and Benedicto, who had hardly recovered
from their astonishment, professed that it was the
cleverest thing they had ever seen, and no Brazilian
ever would have had such a brilliant idea. They were
now anxious to get on board.</p>

<p>First Filippe came and sat himself in front of me,
and I saw with some concern the raft sink down
considerably into the water. When Benedicto also
entered, the framework of our vessel absolutely disappeared
under water and only the short necks of
the bottles showed above the surface. As we sat
astride on the narrow longitudinal platform we were
knee-deep in water. We took another small trip in
mid-stream, and then decided that we would put the
baggage on board and start at once on our journey
down the river.</p>

<p>I went back for the baggage and rolled it all up
in the waterproof hammock, then fastened it with
pieces of liane to the stern of the raft. Filippe and
Benedicto fastened their own things also. Having
made ourselves some primitive-looking paddles with
the bottom of a small empty barrel we had found,
which we attached to two sticks, we made ready to
start.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill2-340a.jpg"><img src="images/ill2-340a_th.jpg" alt="Canoe made of the Bark of the Burity Palm." title="Canoe made of the Bark of the Burity Palm." /></a></p>

<hr />
<p>Filippe and I had already got on board, when
Benedicto appeared with a huge punting pole he had
cut himself in case we might need it. He was excited
over the prospect of having no more walking to do.
When he got near he jumped on board so clumsily
that the already too heavily laden raft turned over
and we were all flung into the water&mdash;there 7 ft. deep.
When I came to the surface again I just managed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-341" id="Pg_2-341"></a>[<a href="images/2-341.png">341</a>]</span>
to pull the craft ashore and then proceeded to save
Benedicto and Filippe, who were struggling in the
water, which was too deep for them.</p>

<p>This mishap was unfortunate. My chronometer
got full of water and stopped; the aneroids, the
camera, all were injured beyond repair. Much to my
distress, I also discovered that the watertight cases,
which had been knocked about so much of late, had
let the water through before I had time to turn the
raft the right way up and pull out of the water the
baggage which was fastened to it. The four hundred
developed negatives had all got soaked. My note-books,
too, were drenched through.</p>

<p>Another heavy task was before me now, in order
to save all that valuable material. It was to spread
everything to dry thoroughly in the wind before it
could be packed again.</p>

<p>Filippe and Benedicto were so scared that on no
account, they said, would they go on board that raft
again. The accident occurred at about nine o'clock
in the morning; by one or two o'clock in the afternoon
everything was dry and carefully repacked.</p>

<p>We decided to make a fresh start. My feet were
so swollen, and with hardly a patch of skin left on
them, that I could walk no more. It was agreed
that Filippe and Benedicto should go on walking
along the left bank as much as possible, while I alone,
with the baggage, navigated the river. We would
keep in touch by occasional shouts.</p>

<p>I got along pretty well, floating down with the
current; but paddling and punting were most difficult,
the raft being almost impossible to steer. On several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-342" id="Pg_2-342"></a>[<a href="images/2-342.png">342</a>]</span>
occasions I had narrow escapes, just avoiding striking
dangerous rocks&mdash;particularly going down a small
<i>corrideira</i>.</p>

<p>After I had gone about two kilometres I was so
exhausted that I called to Filippe to come on board
again. Eventually&mdash;and I must say that I admired
his courage&mdash;he came on board, and the two of us
proceeded quite well down the stream, one paddling,
the other punting.</p>

<p>We got into a small rapid, where the current was
strong. We were unfortunately thrown violently
against some rocks, the central bottles of our raft
receiving a hard knock. One of them cracked badly.
I was quite perplexed when my eye caught sight of
the radiations in the glass caused by the impact.
Then my ear began to notice the sound of the trickling
of water getting inside the bottle. With positive
concern, as the <i>garaffon</i> was gradually filling, I saw the
raft getting a bad list to port.</p>

<p>The broken <i>garaffon</i> was behind Filippe's back,
and he could not see it. He was constantly asking
me whether something had gone wrong, as he seemed
to feel the water getting higher and higher up his body.</p>

<p>"Is the ship not sinking?" he asked every two
minutes. "I now have water up to my waist."</p>

<p>"No, no, Filippe! Go on. It is all right!"
were the words with which I kept on urging him.</p>

<p>The cracked bottle had got almost entirely filled
with water, and we had such a bad list that the steering
became most difficult. Two or three times again we
were thrown by the current against other rocks, and
another bottle had a similar fate.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-343" id="Pg_2-343"></a>[<a href="images/2-343.png">343</a>]</span>
"We are sinking, are we not?" shouted Filippe.</p>

<p>"No, no!" said I. "Go on!"</p>

<p>As I said those words it suddenly seemed to me
that I heard voices in the distance. Was it Benedicto
calling to us? Filippe and I listened. Surely
there was somebody singing! We fancied we heard
several voices. Had Benedicto met somebody in the
forest?</p>

<p>"Benedicto! Benedicto!" we shouted out to
him. "Have you found men?"</p>

<p>"No!" came the answer from Benedicto.</p>

<p>All of a sudden Filippe, whose eyes had been
scanning the river in front of him, gave a violent jerk
which nearly capsized the raft, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Look! look! There is a canoe!"</p>

<p>"It is a rock," said I, as I screened my eye to
look on the dazzling water, upon which the sun glittered
so that it was almost impossible to perceive anything.
But, sure enough, as I strained my eyes a second time,
I saw something move, and a moment later I heard
voices quite distinctly.</p>

<p>Filippe's joy and mine was intense when we perceived
that not only one boat, but two&mdash;three canoes
were approaching.</p>

<p>We had already travelled some eight kilometres
on our raft when we came close to the boats we had
observed. Their crews stood up in them, rifles in
hand, as we floated down. I shouted that we were
friends. Eventually they came to our help, their
amazement being curious to watch as they got near
us&mdash;they being unable to understand how we could
float down the river merely by sitting on the surface.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-344" id="Pg_2-344"></a>[<a href="images/2-344.png">344</a>]</span>
By that time the raft was almost altogether submerged.
When they took us on board, and a portion of the raft
came to the surface again, the amusement of those
crews was intense.</p>

<p>I explained who we were. The strangers could
not do enough for us. In a moment they unloaded
the baggage from our craft and put it on board their
boats. They halted near the right bank, and on
hearing of our pitiful plight immediately proceeded
to cook a meal for us.</p>

<p>The people belonged to the rubber-collecting expedition
of a trader named Dom Pedro Nunes, who
went only once every year with a fleet of boats up to
the headwaters of that river in order to bring back
rubber. The expedition&mdash;the only one that ever went
up that river at all&mdash;took eight or ten months on the
journey there and back. It was really an amazing
bit of luck that we should owe our salvation to meeting
that expedition in an almost miraculous way, brought
about by an extraordinary series of fortunate coincidences.</p>

<p>Had we not constructed that raft&mdash;had we not
been on board at that moment&mdash;we should have
missed the expedition and certainly should have died.
Had we been following the bank of the river on foot,
we never could have seen the boats nor heard them,
as the banks were extremely high, and it was never
possible to keep close to the stream when marching
in the forest; we always had to keep some hundred
metres or so from the water in order to avoid the
thick vegetation on the edge of the stream. In fact,
Benedicto, who was walking in the forest along the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-345" id="Pg_2-345"></a>[<a href="images/2-345.png">345</a>]</span>
stream, had gone past the boats and had neither
heard nor seen them. When we shouted out to him
he was already a long distance off, a boat sent out
to him by Dom Pedro Nunes having to travel nearly
800 m. before it could get up to him and bring him
back.</p>

<p>The trader and his men treated us with tender
care. We were practically naked when they met
us, my attire consisting of the leather belt with the
bags of money round my waist, and a small portion
of the sleeveless coat, all torn to pieces. Dom Pedro
Nunes immediately gave me some clothes, while his
men gave garments to Filippe and Benedicto.</p>

<p>Several men rushed about collecting wood, and
in a moment a large flame was blazing. The sight of
proper food brought back our appetites as by magic.
Our ravenous eyes gazed on several big pieces of
<i>anta</i> (<i>Tapirus americanus</i>) meat, through which a
stick had been passed, being broiled over the flame.
We three starving men did not take our eyes off
that meat for a second until the man who was cooking
it removed the stick and said the meat was ready.
We pounced upon it like so many famished tigers.
The meat was so hot that, as we tore away at the
large pieces with our teeth, our lips, noses, and fingers
were absolutely burned by the broiling fat.</p>

<p>Dom Pedro Nunes gently put his hand in front
of me, saying "Do not eat so quickly; it is bad for
you." But I pushed him away with what vigour I
had left. I could have killed anybody who had stood
between that piece of meat and me. I tore at it
lustily with my teeth, until there was nothing left of it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-346" id="Pg_2-346"></a>[<a href="images/2-346.png">346</a>]</span>
By that time a large bag of <i>farinha</i> had been spread
before us. We grabbed handfuls of it, shoving them
into our mouths as fast as we could.</p>

<p>The sensation of eating&mdash;normal food&mdash;after such
a long fast was a delightful one. But only for a few
moments. Pedro Nunes was just handing me a cup
of coffee when I dropped down unconscious, rejecting
everything with a quantity of blood besides.</p>

<p>When I recovered consciousness, Pedro Nunes
said I had been unconscious for a long time. They
all thought I was dead. I felt almost unbearable
pain in my inside, and a lassitude as if life were about
to be extinguished altogether.</p>

<p>It was evidently the reaction, after eating too
quickly&mdash;and I should like to meet the healthy man
who would not eat quickly under those circumstances&mdash;and
also the relaxation from the inconceivable
strain of so many weeks of mental worry.</p>

<p>I well remember how Pedro Nunes and his men,
when standing around us just as we began eating
that first solid meal, had tears streaming down their
cheeks while watching us in our dreadful plight. Once
more Pedro Nunes&mdash;one of the most kindly men I
have ever met&mdash;sobbed bitterly when he asked me to
take off my clothes and change them for the newer
ones he had given me. I removed from my pocket
the contents: my chronometer, a notebook, and a
number of <i>caju</i> seeds which I had collected, and which,
caustic or not caustic, would have been our only food
until we should have certainly perished.</p>

<p>We heard from Pedro Nunes that it would have
taken us at least six or seven days' steady walking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-347" id="Pg_2-347"></a>[<a href="images/2-347.png">347</a>]</span>
before we could get to the first house of rubber collectors.
In our exhausted condition we could have
never got there. As for the damaged raft, it could
not have floated more than a few hours longer&mdash;perhaps
not so long.</p>

<p>From the spot where I met Pedro Nunes&mdash;quite
close to the junction of the Canuma River with the
Madeira River&mdash;going down by river it would have
been possible to reach Manaos in two or three days.
Dom Pedro Nunes, however, with his expedition,
could not return, nor sell me a boat, nor lend me men;
so that I thought my best plan was to go back with
him up the River Canuma and then the Secundury
River, especially when I heard from the trader that
the latter river came from the south-east&mdash;which made
me think that perhaps I might find a spot at its most
south-easterly point where the distance would not
be great to travel once more across the forest, back
to my men whom I had left near the Tapajoz.</p>

<p>Pedro Nunes declined to receive payment for
the clothes he had given me and my men, so I presented
him with the Mauser I possessed, which he
greatly appreciated; while I gave the crew which
had rescued us a present of &pound;20 sterling in Brazilian
money.</p>

<p>It was most touching to see how some of the rubber
collectors employed by Pedro Nunes deprived themselves
of tins of jam to present them to us, and also
of other articles which were useful to them in order
to make us a little more comfortable.</p>

<p>I purchased from Pedro Nunes a quantity of provisions&mdash;all
of an inferior kind, but they were the best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-348" id="Pg_2-348"></a>[<a href="images/2-348.png">348</a>]</span>
I could get. Among them were six tins of condensed
milk, all he possessed, for which I paid at the rate of
ten shillings each&mdash;the regular price in that neighbourhood.
Those tins of milk were a great joy to Benedicto,
Filippe and myself.</p>

<p>Although the pain was violent when we ate anything,
the craving for food was now quite insatiable,
and we could not resist the temptation of eating
whatever came under our hands.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon of that same day we started
up the river with Pedro Nunes and his fleet of boats.
In the evening, when we camped, the kindness of the
trader and his men towards us was most pathetic.
Drenching rain fell during the night.</p>

<p>On September 22nd we made an early start.
Pedro Nunes went away in a small boat, as he wanted
to go and explore a small tributary of the Secundury.
The expedition travelled up the main stream at a
great pace, with the many men who were rowing and
punting.</p>

<p>Filippe, Benedicto and I suffered horrible internal
pains that day owing to our careless eating the previous
afternoon.</p>

<p class="fsc">Indian Idols of the Putumayo District.</p>
<hr />
<p>I was greatly worried by the man who had been
left in charge of the expedition&mdash;a man of extreme
kindness, but an incessant talker. He spoke so loudly,
repeating the same things over and over again, that
in my weak state, and accustomed as we were to the
deathly silence of the forest, it tired me inexpressibly.
His conversation consisted entirely of accusing everybody
he knew of being robbers and assassins, and in
long descriptions, with numberless figures, to show<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-349" id="Pg_2-349"></a>[<a href="images/2-349.png">349</a>]</span>
how he had been robbed of small sums of money by
various people he had met in his lifetime.</p>

<p>I presented him with &pound;10 sterling, hoping that he
would keep quiet, as that seemed to be the entire sum
of which he had been robbed by his relatives and
friends; also because on seeing our wretched condition,
he had presented me with an enormous pair
of shoes, about six sizes too large for me. When I
walked in them, especially up and down the steep
banks, I lost now one shoe, now the other, so big were
they. But I was grateful to him, as he would not
take payment for them, and they saved my feet to a
certain extent&mdash;when I could keep them on&mdash;from the
thorns, which were numerous in that region.</p>

<p>The prolonged immersion in the water the day
before, while we were navigating the raft, and the
subsequent rest, had caused my feet to swell enormously,
my ankles being about three times their
normal size, so swollen were they. I experienced an
unbearable pain in my heart, with continuous heart-burning
and sudden throbbings, succeeded by spells
of exhaustion. Giddiness in my head was constant,
and I was so weak that it was all I could do to move.
Even the exertion of shifting from one side to the
other of the boat on which I was travelling was enough
to make me almost collapse with fatigue.</p>

<p>We travelled great distances, going on all day
and the greater part of the night, with relays of men,
on September 22nd and 23rd.</p>

<p>The Secundury was a stream with an average
width of 60 m. and in many places quite deep. It
had a great many little springs and streamlets flowing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-350" id="Pg_2-350"></a>[<a href="images/2-350.png">350</a>]</span>
into it between steep cuts in its high embankments,
which were of alluvial formation mingled with decayed
vegetation. The banks almost all along were from
40 to 50 ft. high. We came across a large tributary
on the right side of the river. It was evidently the
stream to which we had first come on our disastrous
march across the forest, and which I had mistaken
for the Secundury. Beyond this river we came across
some small rapids, of no importance and quite easy
to negotiate by the large boats, although in one or
two cases tow-ropes had to be used by the men who
had landed in order to pull the boats through.</p>

<p>On September 23rd we passed some easy <i>corrideiras</i>.
I had slept almost that entire day on the roof of the
boat, in the sun. It did me good. Late in the
evening, at about seven o'clock, we arrived at a trader's
hut, called S&atilde;o Jos&eacute;, which was in the charge of a
squinting mulatto&mdash;a most peculiar fellow.</p>

<p>On September 24th I stayed at the trader's house,
spending the whole day drying thoroughly in the
sun my notebooks and negatives and repacking them,
so that I could leave them at that spot until I could
fetch them again. My idea was to walk from that
place across the forest once more back to our original
point of departure near the Tapajoz River, where I
had left the remainder of my party and the main part
of my baggage.</p>

<p>A runaway <i>seringueiro</i> was induced to accompany
me on that errand, while another man remained with
faithful Filippe in charge of my valuable possessions.
I left with them supplies for three months, which
I had purchased from Pedro Nunes' expedition.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-351" id="Pg_2-351"></a>[<a href="images/2-351.png">351</a>]</span>
On September 25th I went a short distance farther
up the river to its most south-easterly point. From
there, with two men and provisions for thirty days,
bidding goodbye to the men who had saved our lives,
we started, still in a weak and exhausted condition, on
our march back to the men we had left behind.</p>

<p>We only carried food supplies with us. I had left
everything else on the Secundury River. Marching
was indeed painful, as I had absolutely no strength,
and was in a high fever. I stumbled along in excruciating
pain, now losing one shoe, now the other,
when they caught in some liana. There were a great
many fallen trees in that part of the forest, which gave
us no end of trouble, when, exhausted as Benedicto
and I were, we had to climb over them or else squeeze
under.</p>

<p>So great was my anxiety, however, to get back
that, notwithstanding the pain, I marched along,
following the new man, who was in good condition.
We went 20 kil. that day.</p>

<p>The forest near the Secundury River was at first
overgrown with dense vegetation, which gave us a
good deal of work and extra exertion; but after that,
when we got some distance from the water, the forest
was fairly clean, except of course for the fallen trees.
We found troublesome ravines of great height where
streamlets had cut their way through.</p>

<p>In going down one of those difficult ravines I had
an accident which might have been fatal. The ravine,
the sides of which were almost vertical, was very
narrow&mdash;only about 10 m. across. We let ourselves
down, holding on to liane. When we reached the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-352" id="Pg_2-352"></a>[<a href="images/2-352.png">352</a>]</span>
bottom we found a tiny brook winding its way between
great round boulders, and leaving a space about 2 ft.
wide for the water. I proceeded up on the other side,
and I had got up to a height of some 30 ft. In order
to go up this steep incline I had placed one foot against
a small tree while I was pulling myself up by a liana.
Unluckily, the liana suddenly gave way. The weight
of the load which I had on my shoulders made
me lose my balance, so that my body described an
entire semicircle. I dropped down head first from
that height on the rocks below.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill2-352.jpg"><img src="images/ill2-352_th.jpg" alt="Trading Boats landing Balls of Rubber, River Tapajoz." title="Trading Boats landing Balls of Rubber, River Tapajoz." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Trading Boats landing Balls of Rubber, River Tapajoz.</p>
<hr />
<p>Providence once more looked after me on that
occasion. On the flight down I already imagined
myself dead; but no&mdash;my head entered the cavity
between the two rocks against which my shoulders
and the load became jammed, while my legs were
struggling up in mid-air. I was forced so hard against
the two side rocks that I could not possibly extricate
myself. It was only when Benedicto and the new
man came to my help and pulled me out that we were
able to resume our journey&mdash;I much shaken and
somewhat aching, but otherwise none the worse for
that unpleasant fall.</p>

<p>On September 26th my two men were already
complaining of their loads. They said they could
not go on any more&mdash;the man in good health and full
of strength rebelling more than poor Benedicto, who
was in a weak condition. So that we might march
quickly I decided to abandon one bag of flour and
eight tins of salt butter. With the lighter loads we
marched comparatively well, and went 22 kil. that
day with no particular experience worth noticing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-353" id="Pg_2-353"></a>[<a href="images/2-353.png">353</a>]</span>
On September 27th we started once more quite
early, after a hearty breakfast&mdash;notwithstanding the
pain which I always had whenever I ate, especially a
stabbing pain in my heart which was almost unbearable
at times. We crossed several streamlets, one
fairly large, all of which flowed into the Secundury.
Rain, which came down in torrents, greatly interfered
with our march that day, the new man I had
employed worrying me all the time, saying that he
did not like to march in wet clothes. Benedicto and
I could not help laughing at him, as we had not been
dry one moment since the beginning of July, and we
were now at the end of September. Wet or not
wet, I made the man come along. Finding the forest
comparatively clean, we covered another 20 kil. that
day. We had a most miserable night, rain coming
down in sheets upon us. I was suffering from high
fever, chiefly from exhaustion and the effects of over-eating,
most injurious to my internal arrangements,
which had got dried up during the long sixteen days'
fast. I shivered with cold the entire night.</p>

<p>When we got up the next morning, dripping all
over, with water still pouring down in bucketfuls
upon us from above, Benedicto said that if it went
on much longer like that he should surely turn into a
fish. He looked comical, with water streaming down
from his hair, his ears, nose and coat.</p>

<p>The trousers which our friend Pedro Nunes had
given me were made of cheap calico, printed in little
checks. They were of the kind that was usually sold
to the <i>seringueiros</i>, and looked pretty when they were
new. But they were a little too small, and had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-354" id="Pg_2-354"></a>[<a href="images/2-354.png">354</a>]</span>
evidently not been shrunk before they were made.
With the great moisture that night they shrank so
badly all of a sudden that they split in four or five
different places. I had no way of mending them.</p>

<p>As we went on&mdash;on September 28th&mdash;we encountered
a great deal of entangled vegetation, many liane
and thorns, which completely finished up my lower
garments. My coat also, which was of similar material,
was beginning to give signs of wear and tear, the
sewing of the sleeves and at the back having burst
everywhere.</p>

<p>We were going over almost level ground that day,
across forest sparsely wooded and with much undergrowth
of palms and ferns. We had drenching rain
the entire day. My trousers were in shreds, dangling
and catching in everything. When we had gone
some eight or ten kilometres they were such a
trouble to me that I discarded them altogether.
The coat, too, was getting to be more of a nuisance
than a protection. Owing to the incessant rain we
were only able to march 14 kil. that day.</p>

<p>On September 29th we again started off, marching
due east. We had slightly better weather, and were
fortunate enough to shoot two monkeys, a <i>coati</i>, and
a <i>jac&uacute;</i>, the new man possessing a rifle of his own, for
which I had bought 200 cartridges from our friend
Pedro Nunes. We had, therefore, that day, a good
meal of meat; but what terrible pain we felt when we
devoured the tough pieces of those animals, which
we had broiled over a big flame! Notwithstanding
the pain, however, we had an irresistible and insatiable
craving for food.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-355" id="Pg_2-355"></a>[<a href="images/2-355.png">355</a>]</span>
That day we made a good march of 24 kil.</p>

<p>On September 30th the marching was comparatively
easy, through fairly clean forest, so that we had to
use our knife very little in order to open our way.
We crossed a small <i>campo</i> with a good deal of rock
upon it, and as our strength was gradually coming
back we struggled along, covering a distance of 34 kil.
between seven o'clock in the morning and seven in
the evening. I was anxious to push on as fast as
we possibly could, notwithstanding the grumblings
of my men, for now that we had abandoned half of
our supplies of food I did not want to have, if I
could help it, another experience of starvation.</p>

<p>On October 1st we had more trouble cutting our
way through, as we again found great ferns and palms,
especially near streamlets of water, and quantities
of fallen trees, which made us continually deviate
from our direction. The forest was indeed dirty and
much entangled in that section, and thus made our
march painful, liane catching my feet and head all
the time, tearing my ears and nose&mdash;especially when
the man who walked in front of me let them
go suddenly and they swung right in my face.
Thorns dug big grooves into my legs, arms and hands.
To make matters worse, the high fever seemed to
exhaust me terribly. Worse luck, a huge boil, as
big as an egg, developed under my left knee, while
another of equal size appeared on my right ankle,
already much swollen and aching. The huge shoes
given me by the trader&mdash;of the cheapest manufacture&mdash;had
already fallen to pieces. I had turned the soles
of them into sandals, held up by numerous bits of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-356" id="Pg_2-356"></a>[<a href="images/2-356.png">356</a>]</span>
string, which cut my toes and ankles very badly every
time I knocked my feet against a tree or stone. My
feet were full of thorns, so numerous that I had not
the energy to remove them. The left leg was absolutely
stiff with the big boil, and I could not bend it.</p>

<p>Limping along, stumbling all the time in intense
pain&mdash;the boils being prevented from coming to
maturity owing to the constant cold moisture&mdash;I
really had as painful a time as one could imagine on
those long marches back.</p>

<p>On October 2nd we had to cut our way through
all the time, still marching due east. We encountered
two high hill ranges, which gave us a lot to do as in
our weak condition we proceeded to climb them.
We had eaten more food than we should have done,
and the result was that we now had none left, except
a tin of <i>guyabada</i> (sweet cheese). I had become almost
as improvident as the Brazilians when it came to food,
as I could not resist the temptation, and instead of
the usual three meals a day we were munching food
all the time.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill2-356.jpg"><img src="images/ill2-356_th.jpg" alt="Itaituba." title="Itaituba." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Itaituba.</p>
<hr />
<p>The strong fever was wearing me out. The dissatisfaction
of my men because we had no more food&mdash;it
was their own fault, for they had insisted on
leaving most of it behind&mdash;and their constant grumbling
were tiring me to death. We killed a small bird in
the evening. By the time we had broiled it over a
flame it satisfied but little our ravenous appetites.</p>

<p>On October 3rd we reached quantities of boulders
and rocks, which showed me that we were once
more approaching the extensive rocky table-land I
had seen on our outward journey. As we climbed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-357" id="Pg_2-357"></a>[<a href="images/2-357.png">357</a>]</span>
up higher and higher we came to an elevated
streamlet of limpid water running in a channel carved
out of the solid rock. It took us over two hours'
steady marching, going perhaps some 2&frac12; miles an
hour, to cross the summit of that high rocky tableland.
Then we descended through <i>chapada</i> and found
ourselves among a lot of ravines, on the slope of one
of which we halted for the night. There we killed
two large monkeys, which we proceeded to broil and
eat. I never liked the idea of eating monkeys, as I
could not get over the feeling that I was eating a
child, they looked so human. The hands and arms
particularly, after they had been roasted over the
fire, looked too human for words.</p>

<p>On October 4th we climbed a steep and rocky hill,
crossing on its summit another section of the rocky
plateau, a regular dome of grey volcanic rock. Then,
descending from this second tableland on its eastern
side, we had to struggle and stumble through most
rugged country, where I found an extinct circular
crater some 50 ft. in diameter and 50 ft. deep, with a
vent at an angle in its bottom going apparently to a
great depth. Near that spot was also a strange giant
natural gateway of rock.</p>

<p>The descent was steep, and most trying for us
among the great boulders over which we had to climb
on our hands and feet. When we got to the bottom
of this elevated country, the forest we found had
quite a different aspect, which suggested to me the
approach of the big river. We found there plenty of
wild fruit, particularly some small black berries&mdash;called
in Brazilian <i>patta&otilde;a</i>&mdash;quite good to eat; also some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-358" id="Pg_2-358"></a>[<a href="images/2-358.png">358</a>]</span>
most palatable tiny red cherries. We wasted a good
deal of time picking up the fruit instead of marching,
my men complaining all day long of an empty
stomach. They would not take my advice to
march quickly, so that we might then get plenty of
food on the river. During the last few days, as I
knew we must have been near the camp where I had
left my men in charge of my baggage, we had constantly
been firing sets of three shots&mdash;the agreed
signal&mdash;in order to locate the exact spot where they
were. But we had received no answer. Failing that,
it was impossible to locate them exactly in the virgin
forest, unless we had plenty of time and strength at
our disposal.</p>

<p>I made sure, by the appearance of the forest, that
we were now not far off from the stream. In fact, on
October 5th, when we had marched some distance,
much to my delight as I walked ahead of my men,
who were busy picking up berries as they struggled
along, I recognized a little streamlet on which I had
made my camp the first night I had started out on
our disastrous journey across the forest.</p>

<p>My men, when I mentioned the fact, were sceptical
and said it could not possibly be, as we must still be
a long distance from the Tapajoz. But we had only
gone a few hundred metres farther when I came upon
my old camp. There an empty sardine-tin of a special
mark which I carried was lying on the ground.</p>

<p>I think that that spoke pretty well for the accuracy
with which I could march across the forest by compass.
I knew that at that spot we were only 6 kil. from the
river. We indulged there in the last tin of the sweet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-359" id="Pg_2-359"></a>[<a href="images/2-359.png">359</a>]</span>
<i>guyabada</i>, which I had kept for an emergency. After
that we metaphorically flew through the forest, so
fast did we march&mdash;if stumbling along constantly
and even occasionally falling can be called flying.
Even at that last moment, when our hearts were
rejoiced, our progress was impeded by a thunderstorm,
which broke out with such force that we had
to halt for nearly two hours until it slightly abated.
The wind howled among the trees, which shook and
waved to and fro, some crashing down, so that, with
the thunder and lightning and the rush of the water,
it seemed a regular pandemonium.</p>

<p>"The devil is angry with us," said Benedicto the
philosopher. "He does not want us to get back."</p>

<p>My impatience to get quickly to the river was so
great that I could not wait for the storm to be over.
In the drenching rain we continued our tramp. My
sandals had given way altogether in the quick march
that day, and I was once more walking with bare
feet. Marching so quickly, one did not always have
time to detect thorns. That day my feet were indeed
in a pitiable condition.</p>

<p>The last trial of all was yet to be added, when we
had come to within 300 m. of the river. The <i>seringueiro</i>,
from whose hut we had started on our way out, had
evidently since our departure set the forest on fire
in order to make a <i>ro&ccedil;a</i> so as to cultivate the land.
Hundreds of carbonized trees had fallen down in all
directions; others had been cut down. So that for
those last two or three hundred metres we had to get
over or under those burned trees and struggle through
their blackened boughs, the stumps of which drove<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-360" id="Pg_2-360"></a>[<a href="images/2-360.png">360</a>]</span>
holes into and scratched big patches of skin from my
legs, arms and face. Where the skin was not taken off
altogether it was smeared all over with the black from
the burnt trees. We did not look unlike nigger minstrels,
with the exception that we were also bleeding all over.</p>

<hr />
<p>What had remained of my poor coat had been torn
to shreds, so that all I possessed now in the way of
clothing was a shirt. As the <i>seringueiro</i> had a wife
I could not well appear in that condition before her
when we had reached the hut. Hiding behind a tree,
we shouted for the <i>seringueiro</i> to come to our assistance.
Benedicto, who was not so bashful, and whose costume
was not much better than mine, proceeded to the house.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, as I peeped from behind my
tree, I had a moment of great joy. I had been
wondering during the last few days whether my men
had died in the forest, or what could have become of
them, as we had not received an answer to our signals.
There I saw Alcides rush out of the house and run
toward me. His cheeks streamed with tears. "Senhor!
Senhor!" he sobbed, embracing me.</p>

<p>Antonio, who followed behind, came up and shook
hands, merely saying "Good morning!"</p>

<p>"Where is white Filippe? Where is the man
X?" I hastily inquired, in order to make sure that
they were still alive.</p>

<p>"They are fishing on the river." Alcides called
out to them: "Come quickly! 'El Senhor' has returned!"</p>

<p>White Filippe immediately ran up, but the man X
shouted back that he was busy fishing; he would
come up later.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-361" id="Pg_2-361"></a>[<a href="images/2-361.png">361</a>]</span>
Alcides was much upset on seeing my plight. He
ran immediately into the hut and got me some clothes
from the <i>seringueiro</i>, which I put on before entering
the house. The <i>seringueiro</i> was kindness itself to me,
most thoughtful and hospitable. He prepared some
food for us at once. That was a day of joy and
sadness combined. I found that all my men were
safe, but that they had abandoned all my baggage
and all my collections in the forest. They believed
that I had been assassinated by Indians or that I
had died of starvation.</p>

<p>Alcides cried like a child for some time. He and
the others were ill with fever. Those men I had left
in charge of my baggage at the camp in the forest
had remained at that camp for seven days after my
departure. Believing that I was never coming back,
three of them had abandoned everything there, and
even their companion Antonio, who was in a dying
condition and was unable to walk. They had proceeded
quickly to the Tapajoz, where they had found
plenty to eat. Two or three days later Antonio had
become better; he had shot some monkeys and birds,
and had been able to keep alive. Had it not been
for the kind-hearted <i>seringueiro</i>, Albuquerque, who had
started out to rescue Antonio, the poor devil would
have certainly died there, abandoned by everybody.</p>

<p>I heard stories that day which pained me a great
deal. When my men believed that I was lost in the
forest the man X had proposed to his companions
to follow the <i>picada</i> I had cut in order to find my
body and rob me of all the money which he knew I
carried.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-362" id="Pg_2-362"></a>[<a href="images/2-362.png">362</a>]</span>
"If he is alive," he had said to his companions,
"we will cut his throat once for all, and we will divide
the money amongst ourselves."</p>

<p>It was with some difficulty that Alcides had prevented
him from smashing all my baggage open, as
he wished to divide the contents with his companions.
Alcides was an honest man. He had stood up against
that rascal. After a severe fight it had been decided
that the baggage should be left intact in the forest
until such authorities as could be sent up from the
Fiscal Agency could visit the spot and take charge of
my things.</p>

<p>It was then that I understood why the man X
was now ashamed to face me, and did not come to
greet me after I had nearly sacrificed my life to save
him and his companions.</p>

<p>Albuquerque, the <i>seringueiro</i>, had also been considerate
enough to lift my baggage upon stones and
then cover it up with palm leaves, so that it should be
preserved as much as possible from moisture and ants.
During the month they had been back on the Tapajoz
the man X had once taken a journey alone to the
spot where the baggage and Antonio had been left,
hoping to find his companion dead and so rob him of
the money which he knew he had in his possession&mdash;the
pay he had received from me.</p>

<p>Here is another charming incident. Nearly dead
with fatigue, I lay helpless in a hammock which
the <i>seringueiro</i> had hung for me. He and his wife
had gone out to look after their new plantation,
and only my men remained loafing about.</p>

<p>The river was some 60 m. from the hut, and one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-363" id="Pg_2-363"></a>[<a href="images/2-363.png">363</a>]</span>
had to go down a steep bank to reach the water. My
throat was parched from the high fever, so I called
Antonio, who was near me, to give me a glass of water.
Antonio never budged, but called to white Filippe,
some way off, to bring the water. Filippe called to
the man X, repeating my order to him. The man X
continued fishing without taking the slightest notice.</p>

<p>So that, exhausted as I was, I had to struggle
down to the river myself, as those men, for whom
I had almost died, reciprocated my sacrifice in so
graceful a fashion.</p>

<p>I think that I might as well mention here a curious
case of telepathy which occurred during those terrible
days of starvation.</p>

<p>Naturally, when one has before one the prospect
of leaving this world at any moment, and one is
working under a severe mental strain, one generally
thinks deeply of one's beloved parents and relatives.
Thus my father, mother and sister were before me
all the time in my imagination. Sometimes when I
was half-dazed I could see them so vividly that I
could almost believe they were so close that I could
touch them. I never thought that I should see them
again, in reality, although I never actually lost hope
of doing so; but I was thinking incessantly of them,
and of the anxiety I was causing them, as I had had
no possible way of communicating with them for months
and months.</p>

<p>There would be nothing extraordinary in that,
but the amazing part of it all was that my parents
and my sister&mdash;who had no idea whatever that I
was exploring, as I always take the greatest care not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-364" id="Pg_2-364"></a>[<a href="images/2-364.png">364</a>]</span>
to let them know&mdash;actually during that time of
starvation saw me in their imagination lying unconscious
in the forest, dying of hunger, swarming all
over with ants and surrounded by crocodiles.</p>

<p>When I reached Rio de Janeiro in April of the following
year I found there a number of letters which had
been written to me by my parents and my sister during
the month of September, in which they told me of
those constant visions repeating themselves daily,
especially between the dates of September 8th and
September 24th. Those letters were written long
before anybody knew that I had ever suffered from
starvation in the forest. It is quite remarkable
that, except the crocodiles&mdash;which, of course, were
not to be found in the forest&mdash;they reproduced the
conditions with wonderful faithfulness, the telepathic
connection having in that case been established vividly
at a distance of several thousand miles.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Baggage saved&mdash;The Journey down the Tapajoz River&mdash;Colonel Brazil&mdash;Wrecked&mdash;From
Itaituba to the Amazon&mdash;Benedicto and the
Man X are discharged</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">October</span> 6th and 7th I spent inside a hammock. I
was in such a high fever and so absolutely exhausted
that I believed I should never be able to pull through.
Albuquerque and his wife were kindness itself to me,
and looked after me most tenderly. While I had
been away a trading boat had passed. That boat
would be on its way down the river again in a
few days. I thought I would take advantage of this
to go down as far as the mouth of the Tapajoz on
the Amazon in her.</p>

<p>On the evening of October 7th, Benedicto, who
was a great glutton, prepared a huge bowl of the
<i>mam&atilde;o</i> fruit stewed and sweetened with quantities
of sugar. I had obtained from Albuquerque some
tins of shrimps, lobster and salmon, butter and jam&mdash;all
condemned stuff from some ship&mdash;and I gave all
my men a feast. Benedicto brought me some of the
sweet he had prepared, and it looked so tempting
that, ill as I was, I ate a quantity of it. After dinner
I persuaded my men to go back to the forest to recover
the baggage they had abandoned there. Tempted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-366" id="Pg_2-366"></a>[<a href="images/2-366.png">366</a>]</span>
by a present of money I offered them if they would
bring it back safely, they all agreed to go.</p>

<p>On October 8th, however, when the men were to
start, the man X had a severe colic. He rolled himself
on the ground in great pain, and refused to go.</p>

<p>The strong fever had finished me to such an extent
that I did not think I should last many hours longer.
Albuquerque and his wife stood by my hammock
watching me, Albuquerque shaking his head compassionately,
asking me if I wanted to write a last
word to my family, which he would send down by
the trading boat when she arrived. I well remember
hearing his voice faintly, as I was in a half-dazed condition.
I had not the strength to answer. As he
walked out of the room he said to his wife: "Poor
fellow! he will not be alive in another hour!"</p>

<p>Albuquerque was a most thoughtful Brazilian,
intelligent and well-educated, quite superior for the
position he occupied there.</p>

<p>I was still alive on October 9th, much to the
surprise of everybody, and feeling much better. There
was a great slaughter of chickens, Albuquerque saying
that I needed chicken broth badly; in fact, that day
I drank cup after cup, and it seemed to give me a
little strength. Although those chickens had a local
value of about &pound;1 sterling each, Albuquerque would
not hear of my paying for them. I knew what
inconvenience it would be for him to slaughter them
in that fashion, as he could not replace them perhaps
for several months.</p>

<p>Good news came that day, when Albuquerque's
wife entered the room saying that some trading boats<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-367" id="Pg_2-367"></a>[<a href="images/2-367.png">367</a>]</span>
were coming up the river&mdash;she could see them a long
way off, just getting over the Capueras Falls. I
decided to go up in one of those boats as far as the
Fiscal Agency at S. Manoel, where I could obtain fresh
clothes and provisions. Remaining still inside a house
I felt was killing me.</p>

<p>The boats did not arrive that evening. The next
day, October 10th, rain came down in sheets, so that
we could not see more than a few metres in front of
us, and the wind was howling with fury.</p>

<p>On October 11th, when the boats approached, Albuquerque
took me up in a small canoe to them on the
other side of the wide stream. It was the trading fleet
of Don Eulogio Mori, a Peruvian trader, who at once
offered all possible assistance and undertook to convey
me up stream with pleasure.</p>

<p>Mr. Mori, a most enterprising man, who was in
charge of the expedition, was a frank, open and jolly
gentleman, most charmingly thoughtful and civil. He
and his brother had the second largest rubber-trading
business on the upper Tapajoz River.</p>

<p>He was amazed when I got on board and told him
who I was, as the news had already spread down the
river that I had been murdered by my own men in
the forest. In fact, during my absence, when Alcides
had travelled up to the Fiscal Agency to inform them
of what was happening, he had been detained there
for some days and accused with his companions of
having murdered me.</p>

<p>As we went up the stream once more we passed
Mount S. Benedicto, with its foliated rock in grey and
red strata. Volleys were fired in honour of the saint;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-368" id="Pg_2-368"></a>[<a href="images/2-368.png">368</a>]</span>
more candles were deposited on the platform of
rock.</p>

<p>When we halted for lunch, one of the crew died
of yellow fever. After lunch a grave was dug and
the corpse duly deposited in it.</p>

<p>We had not gone far when the trading boats of
Colonel Brazil, under the care of Mr. Jo&atilde;o Pinto,
came in sight on their way down the river. Therefore
I abandoned the idea of going up to S. Manoel, as,
had I not taken the opportunity of going down with
Mr. Pinto, I might have had to wait up the river some
two or three months before I had another opportunity.</p>

<p>Again I met with the greatest kindness on the part
of Mr. Pinto when I transhipped from the Peruvian
boats.</p>

<p>In a few hours, travelling rapidly down stream, I
was once more at Albuquerque's hut, where Mr. Pinto
most kindly offered to halt one day in order that I
might wait for the men who had gone in search of my
baggage in the forest.</p>

<hr />
<p>Next day, October 16th, as I was in great suspense
lest the men should not arrive in time&mdash;Mr. Pinto
being pressed to get quickly down the river with some
thousands of kilos of rubber he had purchased&mdash;my
men eventually arrived with part of the baggage. They
had abandoned the rest in the forest, including my
valuable botanical collection, which had taken me so
many months of careful labour. Alcides said that
the termites had played havoc with all my things.
The wooden boxes had been almost entirely destroyed,
as well as most of the contents. I was glad, nevertheless,
to get back what I did, the man Benedicto<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-369" id="Pg_2-369"></a>[<a href="images/2-369.png">369</a>]</span>
on that occasion behaving splendidly&mdash;even going
back to the spot where the tragic scene had taken
place with the Indian Miguel on our outward journey
and recovering some of my instruments which I had
abandoned there.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of October 16th I bade goodbye
to Albuquerque, and gave him a present of &pound;20
sterling, as he would not accept payment for the
hospitality he had offered me.</p>

<p>With a powerful crew of men we sped down the
river quickly. In a couple of hours we had already
arrived at the rapids of the Capueras. After passing
the island of Pombas before entering the rapids, we
encountered the first rapid of Sirgar Torta; then the
second rapid of Baunilla&mdash;named after the vanilla
plant. The third rapid of the Capueras group was
called Chafaris; then the fourth was the Campinho.</p>

<p>We went along the banks of the beautiful island
of Antas, after which we halted at the house of Jos&eacute;
Maracati, a Mundurucu chieftain, with thirty Indians
under him. A delegate of the Para Province in charge
of the Indians&mdash;a man of strong Malay characteristics
and evidently of Indian parentage&mdash;received us, and
gave me much information about the local rubber
industry. He told me that the best rubber found in
that region was the kind locally called <i>seringa preta</i>,
a black rubber which was coagulated with the smoke
of the <i>coco de palmeira</i>. He calculated that 150 rubber
trees gave about 14 kilos of rubber a day. The
<i>seringa preta</i> exuded latex all the year round, even
during the rainy season.</p>

<p>There was in that region also another kind of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-370" id="Pg_2-370"></a>[<a href="images/2-370.png">370</a>]</span>
rubber tree&mdash;the <i>itauba</i>&mdash;but it was of inferior quality,
as the latex was too liquid, like reddish milk, quite
weak, and with little elasticity.</p>

<p>A few trees of the <i>castanha do Para</i> were also found
in that region, producing the well-known nut which
has rendered Brazil famous in England.</p>

<p><i>Solveira</i> trees were also plentiful all over that
district, and gave latex which was good to drink;
while another tree, called the <i>amap&aacute;</i>, exuded latex
somewhat thinner than that of the <i>solveira</i>, which
was supposed to be beneficial in cases of consumption
or tuberculosis.</p>

<p>Very interesting were the different liane in the
forest there, particularly the <i>cepa de agua</i>, which
when cut gave most delicious fresh water to drink.
The <i>titica</i> was a smaller liana, which was most troublesome
when you went through the forest, as it generally
caught you and twisted round your feet as it lay for
long distances along the ground.</p>

<p>Another wild fruit which was abundant there was
the <i>pajur&aacute;</i>, dark in colour, soft-skinned, most palatable
and quite nourishing, but which gave an insatiable
thirst after you had eaten it.</p>

<p>We resumed our journey among a lot of islands,
traversing the Cabeceira de Piquarana. The main
rapid was formidable enough, although nothing in
comparison with the rapids we had gone over on the
Arinos-Juruena river. There was a barrier of rock
extending from W.S.W. to E.N.E. across the river,
which was there 1,500 metres broad and of great
beauty, with hillocks on either side and some small
islets in mid-stream.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-371" id="Pg_2-371"></a>[<a href="images/2-371.png">371</a>]</span>
Soon afterwards we came to another barrier of rock,
extending from north to south. It was called the
Bigua. There was an island of the same name, the
name being taken from an aquatic bird which is
plentiful there.</p>

<p>The traders talked a great deal of the dangers of
those rapids, and they were certainly dangerous because
of the innumerable submerged rocks; but after the
fierceness of those we had encountered before they
seemed child's play to us.</p>

<p>The river there followed a direction of b.m. 60&deg;.</p>

<p>We spent the night of October 16th-17th at the
<i>seringueiro's</i> farm of Boa Vista, most beautifully
situated where the river described a big curve. In
its crudeness the hospitality of those exiles was quite
charming. They hardly ever spoke; they just laid
things before you&mdash;all they possessed&mdash;and were overcome
with surprise when you thanked them for it or
when you offered payment.</p>

<p>There was a project of constructing a cart-road
for some 20 kil. along the bank, in order to avoid the
rapids which occurred there in the river. Although
those rapids were not impressive to look at, they were
strewn with submerged rocks just under the surface,
which were very dangerous for the large trading boats.
If that road were constructed a great deal of time
would be saved, especially in ascending the river,
when sometimes the trading boats took as long as a
week or ten days to get over that particular rapid.</p>

<p>The first rapid we saw after we left Boa Vista was
the Vira Sebo rapid, slightly worse than the following
ones. I was getting a little better, living on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-372" id="Pg_2-372"></a>[<a href="images/2-372.png">372</a>]</span>
roof of the trading boat, thoughtfully looked after
by Mr. Jo&atilde;o Pinto and the other employ&eacute;s of Col.
Brazil. I was able to drink quantities of condensed
milk, and my strength seemed to be slowly coming back.</p>

<p>The river had many islets as we proceeded on our
journey, with wooded hillocks some 100 to 150 ft.
high in long successive undulations along the river
banks. The coast-line was generally of rocky volcanic
formation, with accumulations of boulders in many
places right across the stream.</p>

<p>After passing the rapids we were travelling through
a region of extensive and beautiful sand-beaches,
with hardly any rock showing through anywhere.
The country on each side was almost altogether flat,
merely an occasional hill being visible here and there.</p>

<p>On October 19th we came in for a howling storm
of wind and rain, waves being produced in the river
as high as those that occur in the sea. We tossed
about considerably and shipped a lot of water. More
immense sand-beaches were passed, and then we
came to a region of domed rocks showing along the
river bank. At all the <i>barac&atilde;os</i>, or trading sheds
where the <i>seringueiros</i> bought their supplies, the same
rubbish was for sale: condemned, quite uneatable ship
biscuits sold at 5<i>s.</i> a kilo; Epsom salts at the rate of
&pound;2 sterling a kilo; putrid tinned meat at the rate
of 10<i>s.</i> a tin; 1-lb. tins of the commonest French
salt butter fetched the price of 10<i>s.</i> each. The conversation
at all those halting-places where the trading
boats stopped was dull beyond words, the local scandal&mdash;there
was plenty of it always&mdash;having little interest
for me.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-373" id="Pg_2-373"></a>[<a href="images/2-373.png">373</a>]</span>
At one place we were met by a charming girl
dressed up in all her finery, singing harmonious songs
to the accompaniment of her guitar. So great was
her desire to be heard that she kept on the music
incessantly during the whole time we stopped&mdash;some
three hours&mdash;although nobody paid the slightest
attention to it after the first song or two.</p>

<p>Farther down the river, there 800 m. wide, hills
and undulations were to be seen on each side. At
sunset that day we arrived at S. Isabel or Castanho,
where I had the pleasure of meeting the greatest man
upon that river&mdash;Col. R. E. Brazil, a man of immense
strength of will and enterprise. He went under the
name, which he well deserved, of the "King of the
Tapajoz"; for it was he who indeed held the key of
that river, nearly the entire commerce on that great
waterway being, directly or indirectly, in his hands.</p>

<p>October 20th was spent at S. Isabel, where a great
fleet of boats was waiting to be loaded with thousands
upon thousands of kilos of magnificent rubber.</p>

<p>Both Col. Brazil and his employ&eacute;s treated me with
great deference, and made preparations to get a boat
ready at once for me to continue my journey down
the stream. In fact, Col. Brazil, who would not hear
of my paying for being conveyed down stream, insisted
upon my being his guest, and declared that he himself
would take me to a point where I might be able to
get a steamer.</p>

<p>When all the boats were ready, at 4 p.m. on
October 20th, we proceeded on our journey down the
Tapajoz by a small channel on the right side of the
river, in order to visit some of the trading sheds be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-374" id="Pg_2-374"></a>[<a href="images/2-374.png">374</a>]</span>longing
to Col. Brazil, especially those at the mouth
of the Crepore River, which was 100 m. wide where
it entered the Tapajoz on the right side. The scenery
was beautiful, the hills getting higher as we proceeded
north, some of the islands we passed also being of
great height and forming picturesque scenes, especially
against the gorgeous tints of the sky at sunset.</p>

<p>I was interested in observing the wonderful regularity
of the sky-line along the forest. It looked as
if the trees had been trimmed artificially in a perfectly
straight line. The fleet which Col. Brazil was taking
down the river consisted of eight large boats. I
was much impressed by the force of mind of Col.
Brazil, together with his great charm and thoughtfulness
when not at work. His men were in mortal fear
of him, and trembled all over when he spoke to them.</p>

<p>No serious obstacle to navigation was encountered
as we proceeded on our journey, although rocks were
plentiful, great red domes and boulders galore showing
through the water and along the coast-line. Whitish
vertical cliffs were noticeable along the higher hills.
The most impressive things I saw in that part of the
river were the extensive beaches of beautiful reddish
sand extending for hundreds and hundreds of metres
at a time. Those beaches were often 10 to 20 ft. high.</p>

<p>The river was most interesting, especially near the
beach of Curass&aacute;, with Crato in the distance; then the
great meadow of "Mission Nova" extending in a
north-westerly direction on the left bank, along the
tributary of the same name. In the same direction
extended also the rocky barrier at the beginning of
the Mangabel rapid. The rapid was formed by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-375" id="Pg_2-375"></a>[<a href="images/2-375.png">375</a>]</span>
rocky barrier extending from north-west to south-east.
We had hilly and undulating country all the
way along, and the river wound about a great deal.</p>

<p>Col. Brazil was steering the first boat of the fleet
carefully as we went through the tortuous channel,
the entire fleet following us in good order. Picturesque
islands of truly tropical appearance were to be seen,
covered with tall burity palms, 30 to 40 ft. high, with
narrow channels between.</p>

<p>The heavy clouds which had collected to the north
suggested an approaching storm, but, as luck would
have it, the sky cleared at sunset. As we wound our
way among the many rocks reflected in the now still
waters of that vast river, the scene was really beautiful.</p>

<p>The channel through which Col. Brazil navigated
his boat was only 10 m. wide, with dangerous submerged
rocks. Mangabel, taken as a whole, was
an immense basin, 1,000 to 1,500 m. broad from west
to east, interspersed with elongated, rounded and flattened
rocks. It was indeed a most picturesque sight,
especially when all the trading boats were winding
their way at sunset descending the various rapids.</p>

<p>After going through a great channel, we went along
a large fissure from south-east to north-west, still in the
Mangabel rapid. The rock of that region was highly
ferruginous. That fissure was of great depth, and
absolutely free from rocks in the channel itself.</p>

<p>When we emerged from the fissure we were confronted
to the east on the right bank by two enormous
hemispherical domes 100 ft. high, grassy but absolutely
without a tree.</p>

<p>The rocky formation of the hills was apparent a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-376" id="Pg_2-376"></a>[<a href="images/2-376.png">376</a>]</span>
little farther down stream, when going along the
great eastern channel of the river. On the left bank
we had hills with <i>campos</i> on their summit. All the
hills I noticed in that region had rounded backs.</p>

<p>I greatly admired the bearing of Col. Brazil as
we dashed down at a terrific speed through the most
intricate channel in the rapid, strewn with sharp rocks.
Had we touched one of those rocks it would have
meant the destruction of the boat, the loss of all the
valuable cargo and most of the crew, as the majority
of them could not swim.</p>

<p>There were three passages there, called respectively
the Casson, near the left bank; the Dos Ananas, in
the centre; and the channel da Terra Preta, which we
followed, on the right. At Lua Nova, the end of the
Mangabel rapid, the river turned in a sweeping curve
to the north, the rocks getting fewer and fewer until
eventually the river became quite clear of them, with
only high hills along both banks. Lua Nova was a
little settlement of five houses and a shed, some of
them whitewashed, with doors and windows painted
green. A small plantation of Indian corn, sugar-cane,
and <i>mandioca</i> had been made, the soil being
extremely fertile at that spot. We enjoyed a magnificent
view to the west and north-north-west, the
river there forming an elbow.</p>

<p class="figcenter">(Dr. Rey de Castro, Peruvian Consul at Manaos, in the centre of photograph.)</p>
<hr />
<p>Close by, on leaving that place, we found on our
right Lage's Point, where the rocky formation suddenly
ended, and with it the dangers of the Mangabel
rapids. Here there was a basin 1,500 m. wide, with
extensive sand-beaches of great beauty. After passing
the last row of rocks, extending from west to east, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-377" id="Pg_2-377"></a>[<a href="images/2-377.png">377</a>]</span>
entire river bottom was of clean yellow sand, so that
the water appeared as limpid as crystal, while a few
moments before it looked of a dirty yellow&mdash;not
because it was really dirty, but because of the reflection
from the rocky river bottom.</p>

<p>From Praia Formosa, which we then saw on our
left side, the river was once more strewn with rocks,
but not in such quantities as at Mangabel. High hills
could be seen all along, which seemed as if they had
been formed by alluvial deposits left there when the
drainage from the high Matto Grosso plateau proceeded
down toward the north in a disorderly fashion,
until it found its way into the great fissures in the
earth's crust which now form the beds of those great
arteries, the Xingu, the Tapajoz, and the Madeira rivers.</p>

<p>I noticed that all the hills and undulations ran
from south to north or from north-west to south-east,
the southern slope being generally more elongated.
After passing on our left the trading sheds of Sobradinho
and S. Vicente, with their corrugated iron roofs&mdash;looking
to us the most civilized things we had ever
seen&mdash;we approached the Montanha, where another
rapid had to be negotiated.</p>

<p>During the night I was sleeping inside the cabin
of the boat, which Col. Brazil had placed at my disposal,
and where I had all the baggage which I had
saved from the forest. In the middle of the night all
of a sudden the boat sank in 5 or 6 ft. of water.
It was all I could do to scramble out of the cabin.
The boat had sprung a great leak as big as a man's
hand, which had been stopped up, and which had
suddenly opened&mdash;hence the misfortune.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-378" id="Pg_2-378"></a>[<a href="images/2-378.png">378</a>]</span>
This sudden immersion in cold water gave me
another bad attack of fever, as I had to sit the entire
night in wet pyjamas while the crews of all the other
boats were summoned in order to raise the boat once
more, a work which lasted several hours.</p>

<p>Next morning when we departed Col. Brazil lent
me some of his clothes, while all my things were spread
on the roofs of the various boats to dry in the sun,
I never shall forget Col. Brazil's amusement and that
of his men when I unpacked some of the boxes, which
had once been watertight, and pulled out a dress-suit,
frock-coat, and other such stylish garments, now
all wet and muddy, and some twenty pairs of shoes,
all in a terrible condition, mildewed and soaked with
the moisture they had absorbed in the forest and
during the last immersion.</p>

<p>Near the tributary Montanha, on the left side of
the main stream, were two small rapids. A rich
rubber-producing land was situated a day and a half's
journey along that tributary. The best way to reach
it was from a place called El Frances, one of the
most charming spots I saw on the lower Tapajoz
River. The central hill at Montanha was 300 ft. high,
the hills around it from 200 to 300 ft. high.</p>

<p>Farther down we came to the Rio Jamanchin, a
tributary on the right side of the Tapajoz, which
entered the river where great sand-shallows occupied
nearly half the width of the stream.</p>

<p>Col. Brazil was the happy possessor of immense
concessions on that tributary stream&mdash;in fact as far
as the Tocantins River, a tributary on the left side of
the Jamanchin. He had already made a mule trail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-379" id="Pg_2-379"></a>[<a href="images/2-379.png">379</a>]</span>
across that region in order to get over the difficulty
of the troublesome rapids which are to be found there,
such as those of Port&atilde;o, Cahy, and Apuhy. The
mineral wealth was also considerable, according to
the accounts I heard; while undoubtedly the production
of rubber could not be better.</p>

<p>This was the spot at which the river Tapajoz came
nearest to its eastern neighbour the river Xingu.
The <i>seringueiros</i> on the latter river constantly cross
over, following the Jamanchin in order to go down
to the Amazon by the Tapajoz. Rubber collectors
have found their way high up on the Xingu River&mdash;much
farther up than on the river Tapajoz.</p>

<p>On October 25th we went down first the Lim&atilde;o
rapid, and then the Burbure rapid. The river was
beautiful all along, with low hills on both sides. We
eventually arrived at Pimental, a fiendishly hot,
steamy, unhealthy place, where across a streamlet
was a station for the transhipment of rubber. The
place was on low ground, which became inundated
at high water. Another station was built some
200 m. off on high ground, which was used as a winter
station. The second station was at the beginning of
an excellent mule track which Col. Brazil had cut as
far as a place lower down the river called Bella Vista,
a distance of some 20 kil. He had imported at much
expense a number of mules for the service. All the
rubber was conveyed from that spot on mule-back,
as between Pimental and Bella Vista was a dangerous
rapid, on which many boats had been lost.</p>

<p>In the company of Col. Brazil I rode over that
distance, in intense pain owing to the weak state in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-380" id="Pg_2-380"></a>[<a href="images/2-380.png">380</a>]</span>
which I was. When we came to the river again, over
great deposits of sand we saw a number of crocodiles
basking in the sun.</p>

<p>Bella Vista consisted of four neat double-storied
grey houses, two large white buildings, and some
temporary constructions of mud with palm-leaf roofs,
all of them situated on a high bank. The place was
at the entrance of a wide channel, dry and sandy.
When this was filled by the stream at high water a
long island was formed.</p>

<p>Bella Vista was a great point for us, for there we
should meet steam navigation again, Col. Brazil having
purchased a handsome steamer which performed the
service between that place and Belem (Para).</p>

<hr />
<p>I broke down altogether while there, and was
nursed with the tenderest care by the family of Mr.
Lage, who was in charge of that trading station. It
is difficult to imagine more kind-hearted, generous
people than these exiles in those deadly regions. All
the employ&eacute;s at the station were in a pitiable condition,
suffering from malarial fever.</p>

<p>When the steamer <i>Commandante Macedo</i> arrived&mdash;she
only came once a month in order to bring down
the rubber&mdash;I went in her to the first town we had
seen since leaving Diamantino, a place called Itaituba.
It seemed to us as if we had dropped into London or
Paris again, although the place merely consisted of
a few red-roofed houses, the walls of which were
gaily coloured, bright yellow, green, or white. Palm
trees of great size showed here and there beyond the
row of buildings as we approached the place on its
high site.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-381" id="Pg_2-381"></a>[<a href="images/2-381.png">381</a>]</span>
Prominent along the river front were magnificently
vigorous mango trees, with luxuriant foliage. A brick
and stone church, unfinished, was visible, with a
great pile of bricks in front waiting in vain for money
and labour to complete it. The grand square, with
its pretty <i>Intendencia</i> coloured bright blue, formed
the end, on the west, of that most important "town"
on the Tapajoz. In the centre of the square was a
well-executed bust of Correa.</p>

<p>The most prominent feature of the place, however,
was the elevated landing-stage, some 30 ft. above the
level of the river at low water, erected there for loading
and unloading when the river rose. The town was
divided by three longitudinal avenues, the central
one also with rows of magnificent mango trees, which
indeed seemed to flourish at that place. I was particularly
struck by the wonderful tidiness and cleanliness,
the good drainage of the streets, and the upkeep
of the different houses, of which the people seemed
proud. Everybody was well off, owing to the rubber
industry, which had brought much wealth to the place.
Col. Brazil and his family have dedicated much time
and energy to embellishing the town, and no doubt
some day, when Itaituba is connected with proper
telegraphic and postal services, it will become an
important city, being the key, as it were, of the
Tapajoz River.</p>

<p>On November 5th I bade good-bye to my good
friend Col. Brazil, whose guest I had been since leaving
the forest, and for whose thoughtful hospitality I feel
deeply grateful. I presented him with my best rifle,
a very handsome weapon, which had accompanied me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-382" id="Pg_2-382"></a>[<a href="images/2-382.png">382</a>]</span>
on several previous journeys, and which was the only
valuable thing remaining in my possession.</p>

<p>It was a new sensation for me to be steaming
down comfortably on a beautifully-kept steamer, as
spick-and-span as a private yacht. Her captain and
co-proprietor with Col. Brazil was Captain Macedo, a
man who had spent much time in Europe, and was
one of the most polished gentlemen I met in Brazil.</p>

<p>Now that my work was practically over, it was a
great relief to me to be basking in a cane chair upon
the deck, looking at the wonderful scenery opening
up before me as we went on. We passed a lovely
sand-beach, Capitary, then the immense bay of Boin,
and farther on the great rocks of Surucu&aacute;. Then
came in sight the headland called Punta de Cururu,
with the Serra of the same name upon it. Once or
twice the ship stopped at different sheds in order
to take up merchandise, but we only halted long
enough to get the cargo on board, and once more we
proceeded gaily down stream. It was wonderful how
one appreciated civilized ways of locomotion after
travelling for months and months, as we had done,
in the manner of prehistoric man.</p>

<p>In the evening, while we were sitting at dinner,
there was a big bump. We had run aground somewhat
heavily on a sand-dune. The captain rather
frightened me as he said that on a previous occasion
they had stuck on a sand-bank for several days
before they could get off. As luck would have it
that night, partly by the aid of a steel cable several
hundred metres long, which had been fastened to a number
of big trees on the shore, partly by her own power,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-383" id="Pg_2-383"></a>[<a href="images/2-383.png">383</a>]</span>
we were able to back out and get her free. Only six
hours were wasted. The tide, which reaches a long
way up the Tapajoz River when the latter is low,
helped us a great deal. At high tide the level of the
water is raised more than one foot. It seemed amazing
that the tide of the ocean could extend its influence
by forcing the water back so far up the Amazon and
its tributaries.</p>

<p>Although the steamer on which I was did not
draw much water, being built specially for river
navigation, careful soundings had to be taken continually.
I well recollect the cries of the man at the
lead. When the man cried out "<i>Una bra&ccedil;a!</i>" (one
fathom), there was great excitement on board, and
we had to slow down to half speed or dead slow.
In the distance on the left bank in the haze could be
distinguished high hills, at the foot of which white
ribbon-like streaks were visible along the water.</p>

<p>The Barros do Tapayuna, a sand and mud bar,
extremely shallow, extended from the elongated island
of the same name right across the stream, there about
5 kil. wide. That spot was also called the <i>garganta</i>,
or throat of the Tapajoz, because at low water it
was impossible to get through, and it was necessary to
unload the steamer, the navigation being extremely
difficult.</p>

<p>"<i>Dos bra&ccedil;as!</i>" (two fathoms) cried the lead
man. "One and a half fathom!" he cried next, as
we went over the shallowest part of that sand-bar.</p>

<p>Although shallow, that part of the river was not
dangerous, because the bottom was of soft mud; not
so, however, farther on, where the shallow channel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-384" id="Pg_2-384"></a>[<a href="images/2-384.png">384</a>]</span>
was strewn with plentiful rocks. Captain Macedo
had sensibly placed buoys and marks all over the most
dangerous places, so as to minimize the dangers of
navigation.</p>

<p>The river was magnificent farther down, where we
passed a great quadrangular rock of deep Indian red,
looking exactly like an immense square tower. Then
vertical rocks were to be seen all along the right
bank; while on the left bank, when we crossed over
to the other side of the river, were immense beaches
of beautiful sand. Above them were great stretches of
the most wonderful grass, upon which thousands of
cattle could graze&mdash;but not one animal was to be seen.</p>

<p class="fsc">A Trail in the Andes.</p>
<hr />
<p>It was rather interesting to note that the formation
of the right bank was exactly the same as that of the
Pared&atilde;o Grande we had seen in Matto Grosso. Vertical
sides in great rectangles were noticeable, intersected
by passages&mdash;regular ca&ntilde;ons&mdash;where small huts could
be seen at the foot of the picturesque rocks, especially
at places where small streamlets entered the Tapajoz.
I was told that little lakes had formed beyond those
frontal rocky masses, the entrances to which were
blocked at low water by sand-bars. Beyond that row
of vertical red rocks was a more or less confused mass
of hills, some dome-like, others of a more elongated
form, but still with a well-rounded sky-line. The water
of the stream had now changed colour altogether,
and had become of a deep green. Islets could be seen
far, far away to the left side of the river, mere white
dots and lines along the water-line, most of them having
white sand-beaches around them; while on the right
bank the great red walls in sections continued for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-385" id="Pg_2-385"></a>[<a href="images/2-385.png">385</a>]</span>
many miles. As we neared the mouth of the Tapajoz,
the river had the immense width of 14 kil. On the
right, after going through the Passagem dos Surucu&eacute;,
we passed the mountain of Jaguarary, which stood
prominent along a flat elevation on the right bank.</p>

<p>We halted in the afternoon at a picturesque little
place called Prainha&mdash;prettier than any I had seen
so far, because of its frontage battlement, with its
numerous staircases to allow the people of the various
houses to go down to the water. A tiny church stood
farther back on a prominence.</p>

<p>Late at night we arrived at Santarem, at the
junction of the Tapajoz River with the Amazon. At
that spot the man X and poor Benedicto insisted on
leaving me, so they received their full pay, and Benedicto
a very handsome present of money; after which they
disembarked. As the sum I paid Benedicto was a
considerable one, so that he might be well off for the
rest of his days, I warned him not to waste it in
buying all kinds of absurd things.</p>

<p>We halted at Santarem for several hours. What
was not my astonishment, just before we departed,
to find that Benedicto had gone into a store and had
spent over &pound;25 sterling in buying innumerable tins of
jam&mdash;in fact, he had bought up the entire supply
which was in the store! When I asked him what he
did that for, he said he was very fond of jam. With
his friends and a number of people he had quickly
collected round him, they opened tin after tin,
ravenously devouring the contents, so that within a
short time he would have none left.</p>

<p>Brazilians of all classes are hopelessly improvident.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Santarem to Belem (Par&aacute;)&mdash;The Amazon&mdash;From Belem to Manaos&mdash;The
Madeira-Mamore Railway</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Santarem</span> was an old settlement of no great interest.
It had a few relatively fine ancient buildings and
many ugly new ones.</p>

<p>Early on November 6th the steamer proceeded on
her way to Belem (Par&aacute;). On leaving Santarem we
first emerged into the great Amazon River, a regular
sea of fresh water, where we tossed about in a strong
north-easterly gale. Unless one knew, one never could
have imagined oneself on a river, as the stream was so
wide at that point that the opposite bank could not
be seen at all.</p>

<p>Things were a little better when we entered the
channel of Monte Alegre. On that channel was the little
town of the same name, half of the buildings being
along the water's edge, the other half on the summit
of a low hill near by. There is a sulphur spring there
with wonderful medicinal properties, and coal is also
said to be found.</p>

<p>A colony of Spaniards had been imported to work,
but they were dissatisfied and had left. Tobacco,
made up into fusiform sticks 6 ft. long and tied into
bundles, was exported from that place in considerable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-387" id="Pg_2-387"></a>[<a href="images/2-387.png">387</a>]</span>
quantities; the inhabitants were also engaged in
breeding cattle, growing Indian corn, and drying fish&mdash;the
<i>piraruc&uacute;</i> (<i>Vastres gigas</i>), a salmonoid vulgarly
called the cod-fish of the Amazon. A big trade was
done in that dried fish all over that region.</p>

<p>In the full moon of a glorious night we could discern
to the north a mountain region with elevations
of over 3,000 ft. Between those mountains&mdash;the
Serra de Almerin&mdash;and ourselves, lay a long flat island,
the vegetation on which was, for that particular
region, comparatively sparse. That island of mud
had formed during the last fifteen or twenty years,
and was at the time of my visit several kilometres
in length. It was called the Pesqueiro. Islands
have a way of forming in a very short time in the
Amazon, while others change their shape or disappear
altogether.</p>

<p>On November 7th we were facing the principal
outlet of the Amazon to the north-east. That main
estuary is, however, not as navigable as the one south
of it, through which most of the big ships pass. An
archipelago had formed at that spot. The fortress of
Matapa, very ancient, stood on the largest outlet.</p>

<p>We went through the channel called the Itoquara.
Another, the Tajapurozinho, was to the south, forming
a boundary on that side of the large island, which
we skirted to the north in the Itoquara channel. The
beautiful island of Uruttahi was now in sight, to the
north of the largest outlet. Like all other islands
in that neighbourhood, it was flat and of alluvial
formation.</p>

<p>In order to avoid the open waters, where the small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-388" id="Pg_2-388"></a>[<a href="images/2-388.png">388</a>]</span>
ship upon which I was tossed about considerably, we
kept to the smaller channels between the islands,
going first through the channel of Lim&atilde;o and after
that through the Tajapuru. It was practically the
same course as the Itoquara, which was called by
different names in different parts. It was narrow
and tortuous, and required great skill in the navigation
of it; but it was extraordinarily deep&mdash;so deep that
all the big ocean steamers entering the Amazon
followed this channel in preference to the main outlet
of the river, which is not navigable owing to many
sandbanks.</p>

<p>We were there in a regular maze of islands, composed
mostly of mud and of recent formation, not
more than one or two feet above the water. For
Brazil, they were fairly thickly inhabited, miserable
huts being visible every few hundred metres or so.</p>

<p>On our right as we went through we had a luxuriant
growth of <i>mirichi</i> palms, some of great height and
close together&mdash;a regular forest of them. At the first
glance as you looked at those islands, it seemed as
if all along the coast-line a low palisade had been
erected. It was indeed a natural palisade of <i>aninga</i>,
an aquatic plant growing in profusion on the edge of
mud-banks. The <i>aninga</i> is said to contain a powerful
poison, the touch of which produces violent itching.</p>

<p>All the houses and huts on those islands necessarily
had to be built on high piles, as the country was constantly
inundated, the tide rising and falling some
three feet in that particular channel.</p>

<p class="fsc">Campas Indian Children.</p>
<hr />
<p>As we neared the mouth of the river, with Para
as our objective, we first saw the lighthouse of Buyussu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-389" id="Pg_2-389"></a>[<a href="images/2-389.png">389</a>]</span>
in the immense bay which takes its name from the
little town of Coralhina. Both this town and that
of Boa Vista were on the left side of us, on the great
island of Marajo. On the right the island of Oya
was visible, and the island of Araras. Between the
light of Buyussu and the island of Oya opened the
great bay of Melgasso.</p>

<p>Considering the amount of navigation that went
through, it was amazing to see how badly lighted
that river was&mdash;the two lights, such as the one at
Buyussu, and the one at Mandy, at the entrance of the
bay of Marajo, being no bigger than and not so brilliant
as the ordinary street oil-lamp in an English or French
village. I understand that all ships navigating the
Amazon have to pay a large tax on each journey for
the maintenance of the lighthouses on that immense
waterway. It is quite criminal that no proper lights
are constructed in order to protect the safety of the
passengers and the valuable cargoes which go by that
important water route.</p>

<p>More picturesque than most of the scenery I had
so far witnessed on the Amazon was the narrow Foro
da Jararaca. From the lamp-post&mdash;it cannot in all
honesty be called a lighthouse&mdash;of Mandy, we made
for the other lamp-post of Capin; and from this for
the third lamp-post of Arrozal, navigation being
most difficult in that part. From there we steered
direct for the Farol de Cutijuba, a light somewhat
more respectable than the others at the entrance of
the Barra of Par&aacute;.</p>

<p>After going through the bay of Coralhina we did
not follow the great channel that was before us, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-390" id="Pg_2-390"></a>[<a href="images/2-390.png">390</a>]</span>
skirted the island of Concep&ccedil;&atilde;o to the left, passing
between it and Paketta Island. After that island we
found ourselves in the bay of Jappelin, so named after
a bird of that region, which builds an elongated nest.</p>

<p>Having passed the Cutijuba Island, and then the
Taxipa Island on our left, in the early morning
we entered between the islands of Arabiranga and
Jararakinha. The larger vessels generally follow a
course outside on the east of this island before entering
the large bay of Marajo.</p>

<p>We could plainly see that we were approaching
a large city, for quantities of little sailing boats were
now visible on the water. Signs of civilization were
beginning to appear on the island of Arabiranga. A
brick and tile kiln, which supplied Belem (Par&aacute;)
with most of its building materials, had been
established there. Alongside the island could be seen
a lot of steamers belonging to the Amazon River
Company. Beyond was the bay of Guajara, with the
city and many ocean steamers looming in the distance.</p>

<p>On November 18th we steamed into the bay, and
there stood the city of Belem (Par&aacute;) before us, while
the noise of the town began to get louder and louder
as we approached the dock. That sound was welcome
to me in a way, and at the same time worrying, after
the dead silence I had been accustomed to for the
last many months.</p>

<p>A swarm of robber-porters invaded the steamer
the moment we came alongside the pier. The bustle,
the loud shouting, the pushing, seemed most irritating.
Ill as I was, for a few moments I almost contemplated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-391" id="Pg_2-391"></a>[<a href="images/2-391.png">391</a>]</span>
the idea of turning back toward the virgin forest.
The heat was oppressive, the bells of the tramways
jangled all the time, the rattle of the medi&aelig;val
carriages on the cobble-stones of the pavement was
distressing.</p>

<p>Things were not pleasanter when I put up in the
best hotel, where the best room I could get was not
unlike a coal-cellar. We will not speak of the food.</p>

<p>Those aspiring efforts at semi-civilization were to
my mind ten times worse than no civilization at all.
Had it not been for the extreme kindness of my friend
Commandante Macedo, of Mr. Ross, the manager of
the London and Brazilian Bank, and of the British
Consul, I would have left the place that same day.</p>

<p>At Belem I dismissed Alcides, Antonio, and white
Filippe, paying their full passage by sea and railway
and full wages up to the day of their arrival at their
respective homes. They had certainly many faults,
and had not behaved well to me; but I am given to
weigh matters justly, and there was no doubt that
those men had endured terrific hardships and, willingly
or unwillingly, had carried through quite a herculean
task. I therefore not only paid them the high wages
upon which I had agreed, but I gave each a handsome
present of money.</p>

<p>The three men duly signed receipts and unsolicited
certificates, in which they declared that during the
entire journey they had been treated by me in a
generous manner and with every possible thoughtfulness
and consideration.</p>

<p>As they had not been able to spend a single penny
since we had left Diamantino they had accumulated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-392" id="Pg_2-392"></a>[<a href="images/2-392.png">392</a>]</span>
a considerable sum of cash. I warned them, as I
had done with Benedicto, to be careful and not waste
their money. They went out for a walk. Some hours
later they returned, dressed up in wonderful costumes
with fancy silk ties, patent leather shoes, gold chains
and watches, and gaudy scarf-pins. In a few hours
they had wasted away nearly the entire sum I had
paid out to them. Everything was extremely expensive
in Par&aacute;&mdash;certainly three or four times the price
which things would fetch in London or New York.</p>

<p>Two days later white Filippe and Antonio embarked
for Rio de Janeiro, with hardly a word of
farewell to me. Alcides refused to travel on the same
steamer with his companions, and left by a later one.</p>

<p>The city of Par&aacute; is much too well known for me
to enter into a long description of it. Since its discovery
in the year 1500, when Vincente Yanes Pinzon
cast anchor in the Mara&ntilde;on or Amazon, Belem has
become a beautiful city. As everybody knows, it is
the capital of the Par&aacute; province, which has an area
of 1,149,712 sq. kil. Geographically, Belem could not
be situated in a better position, and is bound some day
to become the most flourishing city of the Brazilian
Republic. It is undoubtedly the key to the great
Amazon River, although it is not actually at the mouth
of the Amazon, but 138 kil. from the ocean. Through
it is bound to pass the trade not only of that riverine
portion of Brazil, but also of Peru and Bolivia.</p>

<p>Belem (Par&aacute;) is mostly known to Europeans as
the nest of yellow fever. During the last few years
it has been freed absolutely from that scourge, the
cases of yellow fever being now few and far between,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-393" id="Pg_2-393"></a>[<a href="images/2-393.png">393</a>]</span>
owing to the wonderful progress made by hygiene
and the praiseworthy efforts made by the Province
to keep the city in a healthy condition.</p>

<p>The population of Par&aacute; is 192,230 inhabitants.
Many spacious and handsome edifices, such as the
Government buildings and the professional Institutes,
do great credit to the city; while the Peace Theatre
is one of the finest in Brazil. Many private mansions
are of some architectural beauty, and some of the
new avenues and the municipal gardens are handsome.
The slaughter-house, the iron market, etc., are quite
up to date, and the city even boasts of a crematorium.</p>

<p>My object in coming to Belem (Par&aacute;) was merely
to see my men safely on board on their return to the
Minas Geraes and Goyaz Provinces; also to buy some
new cameras and instruments, so that I could start
on the second part of my expedition, following the
entire course of the Amazon almost up to its source,
then cross over the Andes and reach the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>My English friends in Par&aacute; tried to dissuade me
from attempting the journey, as I was in a pitiful
condition. What was worse, civilization, instead of
making me feel better, was smashing me up altogether.
Every day I was getting weaker and weaker, and more
exhausted. I had hardly strength to walk about, less
still to go up or down stairs. Beri-beri commenced
to develop in my right foot, and added to my other
trials.</p>

<p>The English consul told me it was absolute folly
to try and proceed on such a long journey in such
an exhausted state.</p>

<p>Having bought fresh clothes and cameras for my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-394" id="Pg_2-394"></a>[<a href="images/2-394.png">394</a>]</span>
new expedition, I left Par&aacute; on November 12th at noon
on the excellent ship <i>Anthony</i> of the Booth line, on
my way up the Amazon to Manaos.</p>

<p>I will not attempt here to give a description of
that amazing river the Amazon&mdash;amazing because it
is very big and not because it is beautiful, for indeed
I do not believe that in all my travels I have ever
seen a river quite so ugly and uninteresting as the
Amazon.</p>

<p>First of all, it is so big that you seldom see both
sides of the river at a time; its waters are muddy and
filthy; its climate is damp, oppressive and unhealthy;
its vegetation, when you are near enough the banks
to see it, is entangled, half-rotted, and smelly. All
along one's nostrils are offended by the fetid odour
of mud and decayed vegetable matter.</p>

<p>People in Europe seem imbued with the idea that,
as you go along the Amazon, you must be attracted
by the great number of birds of beautiful plumage,
insects and butterflies of all sizes and amazing colours.
Occasionally, especially in the early morning and
at sunset, one does notice perhaps a flock of green
paroquets with yellow foreheads, notable for their
peculiar, clumsy, rapid wing-flapping flight and their
harsh shrieks when settling on the trees. Occasionally,
too, one may see a family of larger parrots dashing
across the sky; but, indeed, birds in the lower Amazon
are not plentiful by any means, nor, indeed, is their
plumage particularly attractive, most birds, except the
parrots, being small and very soberly tinted.</p>

<p>As for the melodious songs of birds which civilized
people always imagine in the equatorial forest&mdash;the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-395" id="Pg_2-395"></a>[<a href="images/2-395.png">395</a>]</span>
song that will set you dreaming while you are basking
under palm trees&mdash;the actual traveller will find the
greatest disappointment of all in that respect. With
one or two exceptions, such as the <i>Troglodytes fuscus</i>,
a small brown wren which emits sweet musical notes,
most birds of the Amazon have grating voices and harsh
piercing whistles, or monotonous deep repetitions of
two or three funereal notes which are more apt to
drive you insane than to fascinate you. Among the
most unmusical singers of the lower Amazon may be
counted the several families of finches and fly-catchers,
and the local thrushes, which feed on ants.</p>

<p>Similar disappointment awaits one in regard to the
vegetation. People imagine Brazil a land of beautiful
flowers, the forest made up of immense trees with
luxuriant foliage, overladen with parasitic orchids&mdash;eternally
in bloom, of course, in the dreamy minds
of the untravelled, and just waiting to be picked
and to be placed in one's buttonhole. The sky,
naturally, over such a forest, could only be swarming
with birds of all sizes, with plumage of the richest
colours and hues; and what else could such a luxuriant
country have in the way of butterflies and insects
than some which resemble precious gems in the
iridescent tones of their wings and bodies?</p>

<p>That is what people imagine. The following is
what you really see.</p>

<p>The trees, overcrowded everywhere, far from being
gigantic, are, instead, mean-looking and an&aelig;mic&mdash;not
unlike the pallid, overgrown youth of the over-populated
slums of a great city. Orchids? Yes,
there are plenty of orchids about, but you never see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-396" id="Pg_2-396"></a>[<a href="images/2-396.png">396</a>]</span>
them unless you go on a special search for them with
a high ladder or some other such means of climbing
high trees. In any case, you would not detect them
unless you had the eye of an expert. It is well not
to forget that in tropical climates, as in temperate
zones, plants are not always in bloom when you happen
to be passing. As for the butterflies, you seldom see
any at all in the actual forest.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most common birds of the
Amazon is a kind of grey-eyed, noisy, mimicking
magpie, locally called <i>guache</i> or <i>japim</i> or <i>jappelin</i>
(<i>Cassicus icterranotus</i>), quite amusing with its energetic
movements, its observant habits, its familiar interest
in everything and everybody, and its facility for reproducing
correctly enough sounds which momentarily
attract its attention. The wonderful activity of
its slender body, clothed in velvety black, neatly-groomed
yellow feathers, and its charming wickedness
make it, perhaps, one of the most attractive
birds near towns and settlements on the river. It
builds elongated nests which are 20 to 30 in. in
length, the entrance to which is in the lower portion.
They are suspended from the branches of
trees. As I have said, the large bay near the
mouth of the Amazon has been named in honour
of this bird.</p>

<p class="fsc">Campas Indian Woman.</p>
<hr />
<p>Another bird of great interest is the <i>araruna</i> (or
<i>Macrocerus hyacinthinus</i>), a magnificent macaw of
great size, which is perhaps the rarest and most beautiful
found in the interior of Brazil from the northern
end of the central plateau as far as the Amazon River.
Its feathers are of a soft, metallic, dark greyish-blue,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-397" id="Pg_2-397"></a>[<a href="images/2-397.png">397</a>]</span>
almost black, except round the eyes, where the uncovered
white skin shows through. I have seen these
birds in flight on four or five different occasions
on the Tapajoz River, and tried in vain to secure a
specimen. I generally saw them in couples, flying at
a great height and speed. These birds are extremely
intelligent, and become most affectionate and faithful
companions to a considerate master. In fact, they
will attack any one endeavouring to get near their
owners. Their beaks are extremely strong. When
in captivity they are disastrous to one's belongings,
as they seem to possess an irresistible desire to
crush and tear anything they see. They can chip
off pieces of furniture made of the hardest wood
with considerable ease. This is easily understood
when you can see them crush into fragments the
extremely hard nuts of the <i>Acrocomia lasiopatha</i>, on
which they principally live.</p>

<p>Sir Roger Casement, of Putumayo atrocities fame,
whom I had the pleasure of meeting at Manaos,
possessed a most beautiful specimen of the <i>Macrocerus
hyacinthinus</i>. It was most touching to see the pathetic
devotion which existed between master and bird
and <i>vice versa</i>. Only the people of the hotel where
we both stayed did not appreciate the magnificent
blue-black visitor, for when its master was out it
spent all its time chipping off pieces from tables and
chairs, and took the greatest pride and delight in
flinging forks, knives and spoons off the dining-room
tables, and tearing the menus to strips. The Brazilian
waiters, in their caution to maintain their own anatomy
intact, did not dare go near it; for the bird, even on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-398" id="Pg_2-398"></a>[<a href="images/2-398.png">398</a>]</span>
hearing remarks made on its behaviour, would let
itself down the sides of chairs and defiantly proceed
to attack the intruders.</p>

<p>Similar but larger and more beautiful than this
macaw is the <i>ararama</i>, extremely rare and perfectly
black. The natives say that it is impossible to keep
it in captivity as it is quite untameable. I saw a
couple of these birds. They were really magnificent&mdash;certainly
3 ft. in length from the tip of the beak to
the end of the tail.</p>

<p>When the steamer was close enough to the banks
or an island we occasionally saw small groups of <i>assahy</i>
palms (<i>Euterpe oleracea</i>) 20 to 30 ft. high, with
smooth stems and feather-like foliage. Other palms,
equally graceful, with stems like polished columns
and delicately-cut fronds aloft, were also to be seen;
but otherwise most of the vegetation was entangled
and untidy.</p>

<p>From the trees hung liane in festoons or suspended
like cords. Creepers of all kinds smothered the trunks
and branches of the trees, which seemed to struggle
for a little life and air; while, when we had an opportunity
of examining the branches of the trees a little
closer, we could see absolute swarms of parasites
covering every bough.</p>

<p>Near some of the houses could be seen the <i>Musa
paradisiaca</i>, the most common kind of banana palm
in that region, with its green leaves ten to twelve feet
long reflecting beautiful shades like silk velvet when
caressed by the wind. I saw one or two specimens
of the bread-fruit tree, with its digitated foliage, and
several kinds of pine-apple plants (<i>Bromelia</i>)&mdash;some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-399" id="Pg_2-399"></a>[<a href="images/2-399.png">399</a>]</span>
with leaves toothed along their edges, others shaped
more like the blade of a long knife.</p>

<p>I was in great pain, and could not observe much.
Also, most of the time we were at a great distance
from the banks, and the river was so wide that it was
almost like being in mid-ocean.</p>

<p>On November 14th we passed Obidos, at the mouth
of the Rio Trombetas, the narrowest point, where the
river went through a channel only 2,000 m. broad,
but of extreme depth. The channel was formed by
a depression between two hillocks 250 ft. high or so.
The settlement of Obidos consisted of two long white
buildings near the water, and a series of stores. To
the left of the village as we looked at it was a high
cliff extending for some 2,000 m. up stream over a
beautiful beach. The cliff showed patches of red
and yellow rock of a brilliant colour, the lower strata
being of a deep red and clearly defined, the upper ones
of a raw sienna colour, the dividing-line between the
two colours being somewhat undulating. There was
dense forest on the summit of the cliff. A good
deal of vegetation had crept down and was clinging
to the side of the cliff.</p>

<p>A little white church with a pointed spire stood
on the highest point of the cliff, close to the town.
Behind the cliff rose a hill of some height, upon which
the better houses, with red-tiled roofs, were situated.
A wide road led up to them.</p>

<p>The water of the stream was of a dirty yellow,
and very turbulent owing to the strong wind that
was blowing and the violent current. Proceeding
up stream, we then came to a hill 300 ft. high on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-400" id="Pg_2-400"></a>[<a href="images/2-400.png">400</a>]</span>
right, which ended abruptly in an almost vertical
red and yellow cliff plunging into the water. On
the opposite side of the river, along the narrow neck,
were lowlands, quite open and scantily wooded, over
which rose great columns of black smoke, caused by
the natives burning down the forest in order to prepare
the land for their plantations. It was at this point
that the entire volume of the Amazon could be gauged
at a glance. As you looked up stream a long bluish
line of low forest could be perceived over the gradually
expanding deep yellow river. Dozens upon dozens of
columns of smoke were visible. When night came
the effects of those forest fires, with the reflection of
the light upon the low clouds and in the water, were
very weird and beautiful.</p>

<p>Greetings were occasionally exchanged upon the
river as a big ocean steamer went by, or an over-enthusiastic
captain let off rockets, which brought
all the passengers from the dinner-table to the port-holes.
Farther on we came to a pretty plantation
on the left with innumerable banana palms crowded
together, and some cocoa trees. At one time the
exportation of cocoa from that section of the Amazon
between Obidos and Santarem was considerable&mdash;some
8,000 kilos yearly. I was told that that industry has
now gone down a great deal, and not more than
4,000 kilos were exported in 1911.</p>

<p class="fsc">Campas Man, Woman and Child.</p>
<hr />
<p>As we went farther up stream we passed alluvial
banks of comparatively recent formation, in some
places only one foot above the water and liable to
constant inundation&mdash;in other places 10 or 12 ft.
above the stream, and exposing an abrupt crumbling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-401" id="Pg_2-401"></a>[<a href="images/2-401.png">401</a>]</span>
section of grey clay on a lower stratum with a narrow
band of raw sienna colour. This yellow band rarely
exceeded a thickness of 1 ft. We had an object-lesson
here, where the banks were eroded by water
and were gradually crumbling away, of the reason
why the trees were so an&aelig;mic and generally died.
The roots, instead of burrowing deep into the ground,
spread out laterally in a horizontal position quite
close to the surface of the ground. That night we had
a beautiful effect of rain and smoke and the reflection
from the fires, a wonderful study of reds and yellows
and dark blues which would have fascinated the
immortal painter Turner.</p>

<p>Farther on we passed an island 6 ft. above the
water with beautiful green grass upon it, wonderful
grazing land, and no trees whatever. On both sides
of the channel we followed, in fact, we had fine open
country all around, which seemed excellent for grazing
purposes.</p>

<p>More interesting to me than the river itself were
the wonderful effects of the ever-changing light in
the sky. I saw no more the wonderful radiations
which had given me so much pleasure in Matto Grosso,
but we beheld here a great haze of delicate tones up
to a great height and a light blue sky above it. The
clouds seemed to possess no well-defined form, but
were more like masses of mist, the edges blending
gradually with the blue of the sky. Only to the west
was there an attempt at globular formation in the
clouds. The clouds of heavy smoke which rose and
rolled about over the landscape helped to render the
otherwise monotonous scene a little more picturesque.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-402" id="Pg_2-402"></a>[<a href="images/2-402.png">402</a>]</span>
Farther up stream we reached on the right a long
island almost absolutely free from trees, except at
its western end, where a miserable growth of sickly
trees covered its point. Beyond was a beautiful spit
of red sand some 2,000 m. long.</p>

<p>On November 15th we reached Itaquatiara, where
the banks of the river were much higher than usual
on the right side. I was much struck by the sight of
a lot of fallen timber lying about on the slopes of the
high bank, and by that of innumerable logs of wood
floating on the water, quite an unusual sight in
Brazilian waters. Itaquatiara was placed geographically
on a most convenient site, opposite the mouth
of the great Madeira River. Now that the Madeira-Mamore
railway is completed, bringing down the
trade of Bolivia and of the Acre territory, there
is no doubt that it will become a most important
trading centre. To my mind it is bound to supplant
Manaos, which is very inconveniently situated, not on
the Amazon River itself but on the tributary Rio Negro.</p>

<p>All the rubber which goes down the Madeira River
has so far been conveyed to Manaos by a great detour,
involving much expense and time. In the future,
I think, when Itaquatiara has developed into a big
city, and proper arrangements are made for landing
and storing cargoes, it is certain to become a most
important centre of commerce. Land is already going
up in value tremendously, although Manaos has waged
war against the growth of a town at that spot, which
will be inimical to her own interests.</p>

<p>As is well known, the Madeira-Mamore railway
was built from Porto Velho, on the Madeira River,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-403" id="Pg_2-403"></a>[<a href="images/2-403.png">403</a>]</span>
around and along a series of rapids and waterfalls
which rendered navigation most difficult, as far as
Guajara Merim, on the river Mamore, a mere continuation
of the Madeira River. The construction
of the railway had long been contemplated by the
Brazilian and Bolivian Governments, but it was a
difficult matter owing to the dense forest and the
unhealthy climate, which equals, if it does not even
surpass, the deadliness of Panama in the time of the
French. The works of the railway were begun as
long ago as 1878 by Collings Brothers, who were then
contractors, but nothing effectively was done until
the Brazilian Government, fully realizing the necessity
of opening up that rich country, especially after the
purchase from Bolivia of the Acre Territory, perhaps
one of the richest regions on earth as far as rubber is
concerned, entered into a contract with a Brazilian
engineer named Catambry, to build the railway. The
Brazilian engineer transferred the contract to Mr.
Percival Farquhar, who, in his turn, organized the
Madeira-Mamore Company, entrusting the actual
construction of the railway to Messrs. May, Jeckill
&amp; Randolph.</p>

<p>They started work in July, 1907, with preliminary
engineering, the actual construction not beginning
until January 1908. Work began with one engine,
a Baldwin locomotive rebuilt, which had been there
since 1878. Gradually the number of engines&mdash;all
Baldwin locomotives&mdash;was increased to twelve.
During the construction six tugs and eleven lighters
were used on the Madeira River for handling the
material. The contractors took into Brazil during<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-404" id="Pg_2-404"></a>[<a href="images/2-404.png">404</a>]</span>
the four and a half years occupied in the construction
from 43,000 to 45,000 men, although they never had
more than 5,000 men working at any one time. Many,
indeed, were the deaths registered, and the steamers
were constantly bringing back men laid up with fever.
The supplies for those men had all to be brought
from Europe and America, except sugar and coffee,
as nothing could be obtained in the country itself.
The four chief engineers were all Americans, Mr.
Randolph and Mr. Jeckill, who were at the head of
the entire concern, spending all their time on the
line in progress or at their head office in Manaos,
which was mostly in charge of Mr. May. One chief
surgeon, Dr. Carl Lovelace, handled all the hospital
work, with the assistance of fifteen physicians; but
innumerable were the lives lost from yellow fever
and beri-beri, the two most prevalent diseases in that
fatal country.</p>

<p>Before the railway was built it was necessary to
unload the <i>battell&atilde;os</i> or trading boats thirty-eight
times during the journey at the thirty-eight different
rapids and falls on the way. The journey over the
rapids took not less than forty days. I shall not speak
of the constant danger to boats, their crews and merchandise.
Now by the railway the entire journey
occupies from eight to ten hours. The length of the
completed railway, now in full working order, is
364 kil. The last rail was laid on April 30th, 1912,
when Mrs. Jeckill drove the last and golden spike&mdash;an
honour which no other white woman, I believe,
has ever had in so inhospitable a country.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Attacked by Beri-beri&mdash;A Journey up the Madeira River to the Relief
of Filippe the Negro and Recovery of Valuable Baggage left with
him&mdash;Filippe paid off&mdash;A Journey up the River Solime&otilde;s&mdash;Iquitos</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">I arrived</span> in Manaos in the evening of November 15th.
I was very ill indeed, my right foot so swollen that I
could hardly stand on it, and so painful that I could
not put on a shoe or even a slipper, so that I had to
hop about with only a sock over it. The doctor on
board had told me that I was suffering from beri-beri,
and although I tried not to believe him I was gradually
forced to the conclusion that he was right. In fact,
atrophy set in by degrees&mdash;one of the characteristics
of beri-beri being that after a time you feel no pain
at all. You can dig a pin into the affected part, or
pluck off all the hairs without feeling the slightest
pain. I was in a bad way, although I never laid up
for an entire day. From the moment I arrived I
"got busy," to use an American expression, in order
to go to the rescue of Filippe the negro and another
man I had left in charge of my valuable baggage near
the mouth of the Canuma River, a tributary of the
Madeira. It was necessary for me to borrow or charter
a steam launch for one or two days, so that I could
save men and baggage. I applied to the Governor of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-406" id="Pg_2-406"></a>[<a href="images/2-406.png">406</a>]</span>
the Amazonas, who had received telegraphic instructions
from the Central Government to give me every
possible assistance. When I called upon him he said
he was not the "black servant" of the President of
the Republic; that he was practically an independent
ruler, and would obey nobody's orders or instructions,
especially from the Central Government.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill2-406.jpg"><img src="images/ill2-406_th.jpg" alt="On the Andes: an Elevated Trail overlooking a Foaming Torrent." title="On the Andes: an Elevated Trail overlooking a Foaming Torrent." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">On the Andes: an Elevated Trail overlooking a Foaming Torrent.</p>
<p class="figcenter">(See arch cut in the rock.)</p>
<hr />
<p>I told him that the work I had done was principally
for the good of Brazil; that all I asked him was to
help me to save the lives of two Brazilian citizens, and
the maps, photographs, etc., which would be useful
chiefly to Brazilians, whatever their political views
were. I would gladly pay out of my own pocket,
within reasonable bounds, all expenses in connection
with the trip. If I had applied to him it was only
because I had found it impossible at Manaos to charter
a steam launch.</p>

<p>I spread out before the Governor a map of South
America, showing the journey I had taken from Rio
de Janeiro to Manaos marked in red. The Governor,
who had evidently never seen a map before, turned
it upside down, mistook the entire map of South
America for a map of his own Province, and seemed
to be under the impression that the Amazon had its
birth close to Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p>A bitter enemy of all foreigners, especially Englishmen,
the Governor was detested by everybody, and
was at open war with the Commandante of the Federal
troops in the town. All the money which should
have been spent in embellishing or improving the
town, was mis-spent in keeping a large army of police&mdash;over
2,000 men, I believe&mdash;for his personal protection.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-407" id="Pg_2-407"></a>[<a href="images/2-407.png">407</a>]</span>
My audience with the Governor did not last long,
and I paid him back in his own coin. He immediately
turned round then, with great courtesy begging me
to stay and talk matters over, and said that he
would be delighted to be of use to me in showing
me around the city. I merely turned my back upon
him, as I would on any nonentity, and limped out of
the palace. Several messages were sent to me afterwards,
which I treated with the contempt they deserved.</p>

<p>As nearly all the launches in the place belonged
to the Government, I had then to apply to the Commandante
of the flotilla of the Government boats.
It will be easily understood that my anxiety was
great to go and rescue my men; so that on leaving the
palace I immediately proceeded to the private house
of this gentleman&mdash;a great friend of the Governor, I
learned afterwards. On sending in my card at five
o'clock in the afternoon I was kept waiting a little
time, then there appeared a yellow-faced individual
in his pyjamas, muttering words which I should not
like to repeat.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he said to me. "Do you
not know that I sleep from twelve to six every afternoon?
What do you mean by disturbing me? I am
sure you would not disturb officers of your own Navy
in this way!"</p>

<p>I very politely answered that the officers of my Navy
were well known for being wide awake at all times,
and not for sleeping the whole day as well as the
entire night. When I explained to him, and presented
the order from the Minister of Marine requesting
any officer of the Brazilian Navy to give every possible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-408" id="Pg_2-408"></a>[<a href="images/2-408.png">408</a>]</span>
assistance, he told me that none of his boats were
in a condition to move out; furthermore they were
needed, as great political trouble was expected in the
city.</p>

<p>I was beginning to feel anxious, as in my weak
state it would have been a serious matter for me to
undertake the river journey in a small rowing-boat,
which journey would have occupied several weeks,
when I could have done the whole thing in two or
three days at the most in a steam launch. Even a
rowing-boat was not obtainable unless you purchased
it outright, and if you obtained the boat you could
not obtain the men to row it.</p>

<p>It is extraordinary how many things in the world
depend on absolute chance. When I returned, sadly
disappointed, to the hotel, I met a Swiss gentleman,
Dr. Alberto Maso, who was in the employ of the
Brazilian Government as delegate of the Minister of
Agriculture for the Territory of the Acre. I had met
him in Rio de Janeiro a year before. I told him what
had happened that day with the Governor and the
Commandante of the Flotilla. Dr. Maso immediately
took the matter in hand.</p>

<p>That same evening there was a meeting of the
Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Commercial do Amazonas, a most useful
society in Manaos composed of the cleverest and
soundest business men of that place. I was presented
to the President, Mr. J. G. Araujo, and to Dr. Bertino
Miranda, the honorary secretary&mdash;the latter a man
of letters of great distinction, well known not only in
his own country but in Latin countries all over Europe
as well.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-409" id="Pg_2-409"></a>[<a href="images/2-409.png">409</a>]</span>
I was received by these gentlemen and the other
members of the Association with the greatest consideration,
and before I left that evening they assured
me that they would procure a launch for me with which
to go and rescue my men.</p>

<p>The next morning, in fact, I was taken to call
on the Commandante of the Federal troops, who
willingly and most courteously placed at my disposal
his steam launch. A delay of several days took place,
as unfortunately the steam launch had lost her propeller
and it was necessary to make a new one. Also
the engine had to be repaired, and a crew had to be
engaged&mdash;a task which gave all those concerned a
considerable amount of trouble.</p>

<p>I had, of course, to pay for the maintenance of the
crew during the journey, and it cost me nearly a hundred
pounds to fit her out with all the plates, knives,
cooking utensils, and other paraphernalia necessary
for her crew of sixteen men. In any other country
three men would have been more than sufficient to
run a launch of that size.</p>

<p>I also had to employ at my own expense a pilot&mdash;no
steamboat was allowed to go without one&mdash;whom
I had to pay at the rate of &pound;7 15<i>s.</i> sterling a day. A
cook had to be employed for the crew, as none of
the sailors could be induced to condescend to be the
chef. Two applicants were eventually found. One who
was willing to do the cooking at a salary of &pound;3 10<i>s.</i>
a day, his chief ability, said he, consisting in boiling
rice and fish. Another fellow eventually undertook
the job at a salary of &pound;1 10<i>s.</i> a day, he being willing
to do the cooking at such a small salary as he said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-410" id="Pg_2-410"></a>[<a href="images/2-410.png">410</a>]</span>
he had never in his life cooked before, and he did not
know whether we should care for his cooking or not.
It must not for one moment be believed that these
men were trying to cheat me, and putting on prices,
for indeed these are the current rates for everybody
who wishes to travel in those regions. The cost of
commodities of any kind in Manaos was excessive,
and went beyond even the limits of robbery. I went
into a chemist's shop to purchase a small bottle of
quinine tablets, worth in England perhaps eightpence
or a shilling. The price charged there was &pound;2 10<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Principally owing to the Booth Line Steamship
Company and the allied companies, Manaos has become
a good-sized place. The Harbour Works and
the works made by the Manaos Improvements, Ltd.,
have been a great boon to that place, and have made
it almost as civilized as a third-class European city.
But obstacles have been placed in the way of honest
foreign companies carrying on their work successfully,
the unscrupulous behaviour of the Governor and the
attitude of the mob having proved serious drawbacks
to the development of the place.</p>

<p>Large sums of money have been wasted in building
a strawberry-coloured theatre of immense size and of
appalling architectural lines, on the top of which
has been erected a tiled dome of gigantic proportions
over an immense water-tank in order to protect the
theatre against fire. The water-tank was calculated
to let down a great cascade of water, a regular
Niagara, on the flames&mdash;as well as on the spectators, I
presume. After it had been built it was discovered
that if water were let into the tank, its weight would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-411" id="Pg_2-411"></a>[<a href="images/2-411.png">411</a>]</span>
be enough to bring down the entire upper part of the
theatre; so that it could never be filled at all.</p>

<p>Except for one or two short avenues, which reminded
one of the suburbs of new North American
cities, there was nothing worth seeing in Manaos.
The shops were almost entirely those of jewellers,
gunsmiths, sweet-sellers, and chemists. It was in
this place that the poor <i>seringueiros</i>, on their return
from rubber collecting, were in a few hours robbed of
all the money they had made during several months'
hard work. There was only one redeeming feature
in Manaos: the British and American business men
in the place were most charming and hospitable in
every possible way.</p>

<p>It was on December 3rd, 1911, that everything
was ready. The hour of departure had been fixed for
ten o'clock in the evening. I went on board at the
appointed time, but the captain of the launch and the
crew refused to put out of the anchorage, as they said
they would not go unless some extra men were employed.
One of the pipes of the engine had been
wilfully damaged, so that delay was caused, and we
could not possibly start until it had been repaired.
The captain of the launch had worried me for several
days. He was in a constant state of intoxication.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>On December 4th, at 11 p.m., I was actually able
to make my departure from Manaos on the launch
<i>Amazonas</i>. I took in tow a rowing-boat which had
been lent me by the representative of the Minister of
Agriculture in Manaos.</p>

<p>By 8.30 in the morning of December 5th we en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-412" id="Pg_2-412"></a>[<a href="images/2-412.png">412</a>]</span>tered
the mouth of the Madeira River. I was surprised
at the sudden change in the appearance of the two
rivers. We saw in the Madeira high, gently sloping
banks, covered with verdant grass and neat trees and
palms along the top of them; whereas along the
Amazon the trees stood almost in the water on the
recently formed islands and banks. The left bank of
the Madeira was of grey and reddish clay (grey below,
red above), cut vertically, sometimes actually in steps.
Blocks of a rectangular shape, in getting dried up,
split and fell over, leaving the banks vertical. The
right bank, on the contrary, was gently sloping,
descending with a beautiful carpet of green grass
into the stream. The islands were charming, with
lovely lawns all round. Blackish and deep red rock,
vertical and fluted, and with innumerable perforations,
could be seen here and there, covered over with a
padding of earth from ten to twenty feet deep.</p>

<p>The journey up the Madeira River had no great
interest. By seven o'clock in the evening we arrived
at the mouth of the Canuma River&mdash;or rather at a
channel connecting the Madeira River with the river
Canuma, which river actually has its proper mouth
about half-way between Itaquatiara and Santarem,
at a place called Parintins. By way of the connecting
channel the two rivers were only a short
distance apart, but that channel was not always
navigable. The steam launch, which drew little water,
would have difficulty in going through, even at that
time, when the water was fairly high.</p>

<hr />
<p>We therefore thought we would stay for the night
at the mouth of the channel, and start on our journey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-413" id="Pg_2-413"></a>[<a href="images/2-413.png">413</a>]</span>
by that difficult passage in broad daylight the next
day. There was a house on the right-hand side of
the mouth of the channel. While we made preparations
to make ourselves comfortable for the night
on the launch, the pilot went up to the house in order
to get an expert at that place to take us through the
dangerous channel.</p>

<p>I was just in the middle of my dinner when the
pilot sent down a message for me to go up to the
house at once, as my presence was required immediately.
I struggled up the steep incline, not knowing
what was up. Much to my amazement, on reaching
the house, I saw before me my man Filippe the negro,
who rushed at me and embraced me tenderly, and the
other man I had left with him in charge of the baggage.
The two men had been picked up by a boat two days
up the river Canuma, where I had left them with my
baggage, and they had come down expecting to meet
me in Manaos. They had got stranded at that place,
and although they had hailed one or two steamers
which had gone down the river, no one had paid any
attention to them, and there they had remained.</p>

<p>"Have you saved the photographs and the baggage,
Filippe?" I immediately asked, when I had made
certain that both men were in good condition.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Filippe. "I have everything with
me. I have taken the greatest care of everything."</p>

<p>That was for me a happy moment, after all the
vicissitudes we had had of late. The most important
part of my baggage was saved. I had taken all my
men back alive&mdash;if perhaps not very much alive&mdash;after
so fateful an expedition. I felt happy beyond words.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-414" id="Pg_2-414"></a>[<a href="images/2-414.png">414</a>]</span>
The man who owned the house was the trader who
had taken Filippe and the other man down the river
in his boat, so I gave him a present of money and also
a lot of provisions which I had on board and which
we should not now need any more, as we should return
at once to Manaos.</p>

<p class="fsc">The Market Place, Tarma.</p>
<hr />
<p>Next morning, all as happy as possible, we steamed
down full speed on our way back to Manaos. We came
in for dirty weather all the time, which obliged us to
halt for several hours and put into Itaquatiara for
shelter. A few hours later we were once more in the
capital of the Amazonas, in the city of jewellers'
shops and filthy food. On landing I found Maxim
guns and artillery on one side of the principal square,
with police troops in charge of them ready to fire;
while on the other side were the Federal troops, also
with their artillery ready for battle. It was with
some concern that I found myself obliged to pass
between those warlike bodies in order to enter the hotel.
I was not so anxious for myself as I was for my photographic
negatives and note-books, after I had taken
all that trouble to save them.</p>

<p>However, the Governor at the last moment became
scared, and went personally to call on the Commandante
of the Federal troops in order to assure him of his
friendship and affection, so that after all no battle
took place that day.</p>

<p>Only a short time previously the flotilla had bombarded
the town. The people of Manaos had got so
accustomed to those little excitements that they
thought nothing of them. There were occasionally a
few people killed, but that was all.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-415" id="Pg_2-415"></a>[<a href="images/2-415.png">415</a>]</span>
It will be remembered that the <i>id&eacute;e fixe</i> of Filippe
the negro was to buy himself a <i>mallettinha</i> (a little
trunk). The first thing he had asked me after I had
rescued him was if I had seen any good <i>mallettinhas</i>
in Manaos. So after landing we at once proceeded
to buy a tin <i>mallettinha</i> with a strong lock. Then I
paid him off and gave him an ample reward, as he
had been the pluckiest and most faithful of all my
men. He was certainly the man who had given me the
least trouble of the entire lot.</p>

<p>Filippe had tears in his eyes when he received his
pay and present. He embraced me and thanked me
a million times for having made him a rich man.</p>

<p>"After all," said he, "we have suffered a great
deal, but now I shall be happy for ever. I shall marry
the girl who is waiting for me at home."</p>

<p>"If ever I come out on another journey, Filippe,
will you go with me again?" I asked him.</p>

<p>Filippe pondered for a moment. "Yes," he said
with determination. "I have proved to you that I
am afraid of nothing. You only have to order me,
and I will go with you. Even if we are to suffer again
as we have suffered on this journey!"</p>

<p>Filippe was a good fellow.</p>

<p>The other man when paid off received his money
and his reward silently. He went out into the street,
and returned four hours later without one single
penny. He had purchased an expensive suit of
clothes, a number of silk neckties, a gold chain,
watch, etc.</p>

<p>The next morning there was a steamer sailing for
Rio de Janeiro, so I packed off the jubilant Filippe,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-416" id="Pg_2-416"></a>[<a href="images/2-416.png">416</a>]</span>
paying a second-class passage for him on the steamer
and a first-class on the railway, as I had done for the
other men, with wages up to the day of his arrival in
Araguary, his native town.</p>

<p>Thus I saw the last of that plucky man&mdash;the only
one who had remained of the six who had originally
started with me.</p>

<p>On December 16th I left Manaos for good on my
way to Peru, escorted to the good Booth Line steamer
<i>Atahualpa</i> by the Commandante of the Federal troops,
the representatives of the Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Commercial, Dr.
Maso, and some of my English and American friends.</p>

<p>It was with the greatest delight that I saw Manaos
vanish away from sight as we descended the Rio
Negro. Rounding the point at its mouth, steaming
towards the west, we entered the Solem&otilde;es River. This
river is navigable by fairly good-sized boats as far as
Iquitos, in the province of Loreto in Peru.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill2-416.jpg"><img src="images/ill2-416_th.jpg" alt="The Highest Point where Author crossed the Andes before reaching the Railway at Oroya." title="The Highest Point where Author crossed the Andes before reaching the Railway at Oroya." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">The Highest Point where Author crossed the Andes before reaching the Railway at Oroya.</p>
<hr />
<p>I was badly in need of rest, and expected to get
it on those few days of navigation up the river, having
dreamt of how I could lie on deck and do nothing,
as that part was well known and there was no
work for me to do. But, indeed, on that journey
none of my dreams were realized, for, worse luck,
the steamer, which had only accommodation for ten,
carried not less than seventy or eighty passengers,
fifty of them forming part of a Spanish theatrical
company which was on its way to Iquitos. The deck
of the ship had been turned into a kind of theatre,
where rehearsals went on day and night. When the
rehearsals were not going on, the men and women,
following the usual habits of theatrical people, sang<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-417" id="Pg_2-417"></a>[<a href="images/2-417.png">417</a>]</span>
and practised flights of notes&mdash;which was a little trying
after the dead silence of the forest.</p>

<p>However, thanks to the great civility of the managers
of the Booth Line at Manaos, and to the extreme
thoughtfulness of the captain of the <i>Atahualpa</i>, I
was made quite comfortable in the chart-room of the
ship, which was as far away as possible from the noise.
We were most of the time in mid-stream. The
river was so wide that we could not see anything
on either side. We steamed up day after day, occasionally
passing islands of some beauty rising above
the muddy waters of the Solim&otilde;es. Navigation of
that river was difficult, as the navigable channels were
constantly changing, islands disappearing and new
islands forming all the time. Elich Island, in the Timbuctuba
group, was fast disappearing, while another
island was forming just below it.</p>

<p>We passed the mouth of the Putumayo River at
sunset one day, a most wonderful effect of clouds being
produced over a brilliant cadmium yellow and vermilion
sky, shining with great brightness above the
dark green trees upon a high reddish cliff.</p>

<p>In a drenching morning at five o'clock we reached
Esperan&ccedil;a, the Brazilian frontier post, which consisted
of half a dozen one-storied houses with red-tiled roofs,
situated on a grassy expanse. Grassy hills of no
great height rose at the mouth of the Javari River, a
southern tributary of the Solim&otilde;es River, forming
there the boundary between Brazil and Peru. Dark
green foliage perched high up on asparagus-like stems
of trees formed a background to that wretchedly
miserable place.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-418" id="Pg_2-418"></a>[<a href="images/2-418.png">418</a>]</span>
Tabatinga, on the left side of the stream, was the
Brazilian military post on the frontier. A neatly-built,
loopholed, square blockhouse, painted white,
was situated some fifty feet above the level of the
river on the summit of the bank. It was reached by
a long flight of white cement steps. The Brazilian
flag flew gaily upon a flagstaff at this most westerly
point of the great Brazilian Republic on the Amazon
(Solim&otilde;es) River.</p>

<p>A few soldiers dressed in khaki stood, with their legs
wide apart, watching the arrival of the steamer, while
their officers in speckless white clothes hastily descended
the long flight of steps and came on board, bringing
bouquets of flowers to the captain.</p>

<p>There was a pretty garden near the blockhouse.
Three mountain guns pointed viciously at the river
from the most exposed position in Tabatinga at the
top of the staircase. According to the account of a
non-commissioned officer, there was a force there of
240 soldiers "<i>escondido no matto</i>"&mdash;that is to say,
kept hidden in the forest!</p>

<p>After we had passed the frontier on the north side
of the river, a tiny tributary brook, almost hidden by
the vegetation and only identified by a white-barked
tree on the left bank and huts on either side, the
scenery made a change for the better.</p>

<p>Leticia was the name of the Peruvian frontier
post, which consisted of two or three brick sheds with
corrugated iron roofs.</p>

<p>We arrived at Iquitos on December 23rd, at 8.30 a.m.,
having employed seven days and twenty hours on our
run from Manaos.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> change in the characteristics of the people the
moment you were in Peru was considerable, and
striking was the neatness of the buildings. Iquitos
was a pleasant little city, the streets of which needed
paving badly, but were otherwise well aligned and
tidy. There were numbers of foreigners there, including
a small English colony made up of employ&eacute;s
of the Booth Line and the representatives of a few
commercial houses. It is difficult to realize how
pleasant Englishmen can be when they live in those
out-of-the-way places.</p>

<p>After the Putumayo atrocities a proper English
Consulate, in charge of Mr. Mitchell, formerly our vice-consul
in Paris, had been established there. Yellow
fever was rampant at that time in Iquitos, and reaped
many victims daily.</p>

<p>Although Iquitos was 2,300 kil. farther up the river
than Manaos, the price of all commodities in that
country was less than half those in Manaos, and the
quality of the articles twice as good. That is what
comes of having free trade instead of a high tariff.</p>

<p>I spent a pleasant Christmas in Iquitos, all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-420" id="Pg_2-420"></a>[<a href="images/2-420.png">420</a>]</span>
English residents there showing me the greatest kindness.
From Iquitos the river was no longer navigable
for ocean-going steamers, and it was necessary to
travel by small launches. There was no regular
service, but there were a number of trading launches
which went a certain distance up the river in order
to trade with the different houses on the banks of
the stream. The travelling was not particularly rapid,
as one stopped ten or twenty times a day, and wasted
endless time while the people came on board to buy
beer or rum, or cotton goods, looking-glasses, etc.,
etc. Rubber and aigrettes, as well as money, were
given in exchange for the goods received.</p>

<p>I left Iquitos on December 29th, on the launch
<i>Rimac</i>, belonging to the Swiss firm of Messikommer.
I was told that she would be ready to start at 9 a.m.
sharp on December 28th, and at that time I got on
board. The actual time of our departure was at 6.30
in the afternoon of December 29th. That was, of
course, Iquitos punctuality.</p>

<p>The Prefect of the Province of Loreto had shown
me much civility, and had telegraphed, by the wireless
installation which had been established between
Iquitos and Lima, making every possible arrangement
for me to travel quickly. Thus, although in a terrible
condition of health, I was able to make a record
journey between Iquitos and Lima, the capital of Peru.</p>

<p class="fsc">Oroya, the Highest Railway Station in the World.</p>
<hr />
<p>Once started in the launch <i>Rimac</i>, we went through
interesting channels, outlets of the main stream being
often noticeable on either bank, cutting wide passages
through the forest and forming one or more shallow
lakelets, with innumerable aquatic plants on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-421" id="Pg_2-421"></a>[<a href="images/2-421.png">421</a>]</span>
surface of the water. As we went farther it became
easy to understand how islands were constantly
forming in the river. Quantities of large and small
logs of wood were continually floating down the stream;
the banks were gradually being eaten away by the
current. Whole trees fell down with their immense
branches and polypi-like roots, and formed a barrier
arresting the progress of the floating wood. Particles of
earth deposited by wind and by water saturated with
impurities settled there. Soon grass would begin to
grow on those deposits, which quickly collected more
deposits of flying and floating particles. The soft
bottom of the river, disturbed by the deviated current,
piled up mud against the submerged branches resting
on the river-bed. Quickly an island was then formed;
more wood accumulated, more grass, more mud;
the base of the islands would increase rapidly, and
in the space of a few years islands several kilometres
in length rose above the water.</p>

<p>We had reached a point where the two great rivers
Mara&ntilde;on and Ucayalli&mdash;both descending from the
Andes&mdash;joined and formed the river Solim&otilde;es, which
we had so far navigated. We followed the Ucayalli.</p>

<p>On December 31st we entered a small arm on the
left side of the river and we reached no less a place
than New York&mdash;very dissimilar, I can assure you,
from its namesake of the United States of North
America. Far from seeing skyscrapers, brilliantly
illuminated streets, and ferry-boats and steamers
galore, there were only half a dozen thatched huts
with <i>bona</i>-palm walls and floors. In the water floated
two or three small canoes; that was all. The place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-422" id="Pg_2-422"></a>[<a href="images/2-422.png">422</a>]</span>
was chiefly remarkable for the number and the
fierceness of its mosquitoes&mdash;regular clouds of them.
Only one thing New York of Ucayalli seemed to have
in common with New York of the United States&mdash;the
people seemed to be able to stand a lot of drink.
They purchased from the <i>Rimac</i> a number of boxes
of beer.</p>

<p>We proceeded. In a way it was amusing to travel
on a trading boat. Every time we approached a hut
the steamer blew her whistle; the people got up,
at any time of the night, to come on board and see
what there was for sale. I slept on deck, and from
my bed could see what was going on all the time.</p>

<p>St. Helena came next, with its depot and farmhouse.
A few cows could be seen grazing on the
poorest kind of grass. We could often get good fruit
at those farmhouses, principally bananas, pineapples,
and <i>mam&atilde;o</i>. Then we stopped at Reque&ntilde;a, on the
left bank of the river, where a wireless telegraphic
station of the Telefunken system was established. It
was quite a nice little place, with a few houses, built
of unbaked clay and roofed with zinc.</p>

<p class="fsc">The Highest Point of the Oroya Railway: the Galera Tunnel.</p>
<hr />
<p>It was entertaining to watch the pride of the local
gentlemen when they showed me their houses&mdash;mere
sheds of the humblest description, but in their eyes
far superior to any palace of Europe. An imported
chair or an antiquated desk would supply them
with conversation to last hours. The wives of those
settlers were generally eccentric persons who looked
suspiciously at us. One of them at Reque&ntilde;a made
me feel most uncomfortable by the annoying way
in which she looked at my only shoe&mdash;as I was unable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-423" id="Pg_2-423"></a>[<a href="images/2-423.png">423</a>]</span>
to put a shoe on the other much swollen foot. She
never took her eyes off that shoe, and stooped down
many times to examine it closer.</p>

<p>A short distance from Reque&ntilde;a, still on the left
side of the river, was the mouth of the Tapiche River,
a tributary of the Ucayalli. On the right bank of
this river was California, and then Avispa&mdash;a pretty
spot. Two new red-roofed houses with large verandas
stood prominent on a green grassy hill about 120 ft.
high, while on the ridge in continuation of the hill
itself could be seen a number of small houses, some
with zinc roofs, others with <i>bona</i> roofs and walls.</p>

<p>The Ucayalli was a rich stream. It was interesting
to notice how many trading launches were to be seen
on that river, and the amazing part of it was that they
could all exist. Hardly a day went by that we did
not meet two or three launches. We were also constantly
meeting canoes, generally hollowed out of
tree-trunks, and larger boats of a more solid construction.</p>

<p>The population was entirely composed of a mixture
of Spanish and Indian types and of pure Indians.
Some of the latter had Mongolian characteristics;
others were more of the Malay and Papuan types.</p>

<p>After the first day or two the voyage on the launch
was tedious. One got tired of the endless conversation
and of listening to the bargaining. The perpetual
drinking which had to be witnessed was of little interest
to a teetotaller. One seldom saw money change
hands, all being done by barter, the merchandise we
had on board being exchanged chiefly for rubber.
Even so far up the river civilization had well set in,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-424" id="Pg_2-424"></a>[<a href="images/2-424.png">424</a>]</span>
and great caution was needed in buying balls of rubber.
It was advisable to split them in two before purchase,
as they generally contained all kinds of rubbish instead
of pure coagulated latex.</p>

<p>After Brazil, however, the villages and houses of
Peru looked clean and neat.</p>

<p>The prices of food were somewhat high, chickens
fetching 4<i>s.</i> each, whereas in Iquitos they fetched
from 8<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i>; eggs sold for 6<i>d.</i> each, and were
generally bad, the good ones being eaten by the people
themselves.</p>

<p>We went up the Tapiche River, a tributary on the
right bank, and visited the estate newly bought by
an American company. In fact, we were there at
midnight of December 31st, and drank in the New
Year with Mr. Anzelius, the director, and his Polish
and Italian assistants.</p>

<p>On January 2nd, 1912, we saw a great many Indians
along the banks of the river, who ran away when they
saw the camera pointed at them.</p>

<p>The people on that river were fond of giving high-sounding
names to their houses. We passed a place
called Philadelphia, where a large farm with lean
cattle, ducks and fowls, could be seen, looking as
miserable as possible; also plenty of banana palms
and sugar-cane.</p>

<p>Some way off, after passing the large saw-mills
of Cumaseba and Tamanco, where an interesting
collection of animals and Indian weapons had been
made by the proprietor, we came in the evening to
the farm of Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>Early on January 3rd we passed San Roque, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-425" id="Pg_2-425"></a>[<a href="images/2-425.png">425</a>]</span>
then Condorcanqui, a fine plantation of bananas along
the river bank, and also a plantation of <i>yuta</i> (jute) and
some bread trees. Clouds of aigrette storks could be seen
in the evening circling about, thousands and thousands
of them. They produced a most curious effect in the
distance against the heavy black clouds of the sky.</p>

<p>We entered the Yanna Yakka stream, the water
of which was almost absolutely stagnant and as black
as ink, full of snakes, fish, and crocodiles. Yanna
Yakka in the local Indian language means "black
water." We steamed for two hours up that river as
far as Porto Central, the river being quite narrow&mdash;only
150 m. wide. We eventually arrived at the
prettiest spot I had so far seen on the river, called
Porto Principal. On an elongated island not more
than 80 m. wide were to be seen four large buildings
of <i>bona</i> palm, with spacious verandas and corrugated
iron roofs. The buildings were connected by high
bridges. All those structures were built on piles
12 ft. high. Many <i>chapaha</i> palms of great height
were to be seen there.</p>

<p>I heard at that place an extraordinary account of
how a dirigible balloon, with nobody on board, had
some few years before passed over the house. The
balloon&mdash;which my informant, in his ignorant language,
called a "huge square globe"&mdash;flew, according to
him, a flag, the stars and stripes, and had an anchor
dangling down. The balloon was travelling in a
westerly direction. It flew a little higher than the
trees, and caused a great scare among the natives.
My informant told me that there was no one in the
car at all, but they waved their hands at him (<i>sic</i>)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-426" id="Pg_2-426"></a>[<a href="images/2-426.png">426</a>]</span>
when they passed over his house! He then told me
that the air-ship had passed in the daytime and
had quickly disappeared, but that it was beautifully
lighted with coloured lights at night. So that it
would be difficult from that truthful account to place
much reliance on what the man said or on what he
had seen at all. It is quite possible&mdash;after discarding
all the indisputable embroidery from the
story&mdash;that a balloon actually went over that place,
and it may probably have been Wellman's abandoned
balloon with which he had tried to go across the
Atlantic.</p>

<p>On January 3rd and 4th we had no great excitement.
We stopped at numberless places. Nearly all the
houses in that district were made in three sections,
the two end rooms enclosed in <i>bona</i>-palm walls, while
the central and larger room had two open sides. All
the houses were perched up on piles, owing to the
frequent inundations. Sewing-machines and gramophones
were to be found in nearly every house. All
the women wore, rather becomingly over such ugly
countenances, the valuable hats which generally go
under the name of "Panamas." The river was getting
beautiful as we went farther up, immense grassy
stretches being visible where the country was not
inundated, and low shrubs emerging from the water
in the many channels that were formed everywhere.</p>

<p class="fsc">A. B. Leguia, the President of the Peruvian Republic.</p>
<hr />
<p>On January 5th we arrived at Terra Blanca, where
a lakelet had been formed by an outlet of the river
on the left bank. A place called Pernambuco was
situated at the entrance of this lake. The water of
the lake was beautifully clear and of a wonderful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-427" id="Pg_2-427"></a>[<a href="images/2-427.png">427</a>]</span>
greenish colour. Beautiful white and yellow sand
deposits were to be found around it. Five hundred
people lived at Pernambuco. The <i>Rimac</i> did a brisk
trade, over a hundred pounds sterling worth of goods
being sold in an hour at that place.</p>

<p>On January 6th I saw the first hills of importance
we had seen since leaving the lower Amazon. Those
were the hills of Petronilla, where a mass of volcanic
rocks and some interesting hot springs were to be
found. A ridge ran from south-east to north-west in
symmetrical undulations up to 1,000 ft. from Petronilla
to Cancha Huayo. It rose quite abruptly from
the flat alluvial land. Where a land-slide had occurred
it showed an upper stratum of grey alluvial deposit
10 ft. thick, with soft yellow volcanic rock underneath,
in a stratum of 30 ft. thick. It seemed as if that hill
had been lifted up by volcanic pressure from underneath,
as a lot of white and yellow sand had been
brought to the surface, which evidently formed a
substratum in the Ucayalli region.</p>

<p>We found strong whirlpools where the channel
of the river formed an elbow at the foot of the mountain.
The steam launch made poor progress against the
strong current.</p>

<p>On January 7th we arrived at the large settlement
of Condamano, a sub-Prefecture in the big province
of Loreto. There were two parallel streets, clean and
well kept, with others intersecting at right angles.
On the main street along the water front were many
large commercial houses, handsome buildings of <i>ca&ntilde;a</i>
walls and zinc roofs. The place had been built on a
flat high land about 30 ft. above the river, and had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-428" id="Pg_2-428"></a>[<a href="images/2-428.png">428</a>]</span>
some 1,500 to 2,000 inhabitants. One of the peculiarities
of Condamano was that during the rubber-collecting
season the population consisted almost
entirely of women, as the men were in the forest
collecting the latex.</p>

<p>We arrived there on a feast day&mdash;they have more
feast days than working days in the week in that
country&mdash;and the streets were alive with monks and
soldiers, the only men who do not go collecting rubber.
Women and girls, in flesh-coloured stockings and lace
mantillas, flocked out of the church, each carrying
a small carpet which they used to prevent spoiling
their finery when kneeling down.</p>

<p>On leaving Condamano we came to the north-westerly
end of the range we had seen the day before.
It ended abruptly in almost vertical walls of yellow
sandstone of various shades. The range was thickly
wooded on its summit. The opposite bank of the
river was absolutely flat.</p>

<p>That evening we came in for a heavy storm, which
compelled us to halt from 6 o'clock until 2.10 a.m.
Black clouds had accumulated overhead to the west.
A boisterous gust of wind suddenly caught us, which
swept off our chicken-coop, buckets, and other loose
things which were on the roof of the launch. We
were tossed about in a most alarming way, and were
just able to tie up under shelter and make fast to
some trees. The wind increased in fury, and the
launch tore up her moorings, bringing down a big
tree on the top of us with a tremendous crash.</p>

<p>There was a stampede on board, as everybody
thought we had been struck by lightning. Some of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-429" id="Pg_2-429"></a>[<a href="images/2-429.png">429</a>]</span>
the people were just able to jump on shore, while
other Peruvians, men and women, scared to death
by the diabolic clashing of thunder and the vivid
lightning, knelt on the decks and prayed fervently
that we might escape unhurt.</p>

<p>I had a narrow escape, a lighted petroleum lamp
which swung above getting off its hook and falling
on my head, upsetting all the petroleum over me.
Fortunately it went out as it fell on me. In the
middle of the night we had a great deal of trouble to
make the boat fast once more, the waves in the river
being of great height. The rattle of all the merchandise
and broken crockery on board, the moans of the
scared Peruvians, with the howling of the wind, made
a regular pandemonium.</p>

<p>When we proceeded up the river next morning
we came upon more interesting islands in course of
formation. We saw quantities of <i>ca&ntilde;a baraba</i>, wild
cane, with its fan-disposed, elongated leaves. The
natives used the reeds for walling their houses. Being
absolutely straight, they are well adapted for that
purpose.</p>

<p>On January 9th we passed several villages. Along
the banks we saw many Indians, all dressed up
in bright costumes, principally red shawls. We entered
a tiny channel on the right bank and went as
far as a place called San Jeronimo, a fairly large
settlement. This small channel was, as late as 1895,
the main stream, which has since been diverted by
the formation of a low island. At sunset we perceived
to the west what appeared at first a mass of
low clouds revolving in a circle at a great speed. On<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-430" id="Pg_2-430"></a>[<a href="images/2-430.png">430</a>]</span>
closer inspection we found it to be millions of <i>gar&ccedil;as</i>
or aigrette storks flying in a circle.</p>

<p>I arrived in the evening of January 10th at Masisea,
where another wireless telegraph station had been
established by the Peruvian Government. At this
place I left the launch <i>Rimac</i>, and found the Government
launch <i>Esploradora</i>, which had been detained there
by the Prefect of Loreto for two days, awaiting my
arrival. Having transhipped at once, I was able to
proceed on January 11th on the latter. She was to
take me as far as possible toward the foot of the Andes.</p>

<p>As we proceeded up the river we saw extensive
farms surrounded by clearings of good land, with lots
of cattle and horses, especially on the left bank of the
river. We purchased an ox, so as to have fresh meat
on board.</p>

<p>The small launch was, unfortunately, packed with
a great many Peruvian travellers. There were no
cabins, and one had to sleep on the roof of the launch.
Everybody was most civil, and with the new camp-bed
I had purchased in Manaos I was able to make
myself as comfortable as was possible under the circumstances.</p>

<p>Beautiful specimens of <i>cataua</i> trees of great height
were constantly to be seen in the forest along the
banks. The resin from these trees is extremely
poisonous, and is much used by the local Indians for
killing fish. We halted for five hours that day in
order to take on board sufficient wood for the engines
to last us the entire journey. At 6.30 that afternoon
we left the Ucayalli river and entered the tributary
Pachitea, on the left side, the Ucayalli describing a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-431" id="Pg_2-431"></a>[<a href="images/2-431.png">431</a>]</span>
big curve where the Pachitea enters it. Just before
reaching the mouth of the Pachitea, the Ucayalli
had first a big arm deviating from the main stream on
the left bank, then soon after another great arm also on
the left side. The navigation of those rivers was now
getting difficult, and we had to halt at night.</p>

<p>On January 12th we started up the Pachitea River,
a stream much smaller than the Ucayalli, but more
interesting. Soon after departing we could perceive
in the distance before us a high hill range. Crocodiles
and white storks were innumerable, while fallen trees
impeded navigation constantly. Once or twice we
banged with such force against immense floating
logs of wood that it made the launch quiver in a most
alarming way. In the dirty water of the stream it
was not always possible to detect the floating logs,
which sometimes were just under the surface of the
water. Immense quantities of <i>ca&ntilde;a baraba</i> were to
be seen on the banks, and great numbers of delicately-tinted
violet flowers which enlivened the landscape.
The <i>ca&ntilde;a</i> had light violet-coloured <i>panaches</i>, which
were much used by the Indians in the manufacture
of their arrows. The banks were of alluvial formation.
Islets of grey sand mixed with volcanic ashes could
be seen. The current was strong.</p>

<p>We saw large families of <i>ciancias</i>&mdash;beautiful birds
with velvety black bodies speckled with white, and
fan tails of rich brown colour, feathers of the same
colour being also on the outer half of the wings. They
possessed slender, most elegant necks, small brown-crested
heads, and light yellow chests. Seen at a
distance they were not, in shape, unlike pheasants.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-432" id="Pg_2-432"></a>[<a href="images/2-432.png">432</a>]</span>
Twenty or thirty together at a time could be seen
playing among the lower branches of the trees along
the edge of the river. Then there were small birds
of a beautiful metallic blue-black, with very long
tails; these latter were innumerable near the water.</p>

<hr />
<p>The rainy season was in full swing. In the morning
we generally had white mist rising among the trees,
while during the day rain was usually plentiful and
rendered travelling somewhat monotonous, as we could
not see much. We saw many specimens of the <i>tagua</i>
or <i>yarina</i>, a small palm, the leaves of which were
used in that region for roofing houses. At last we
came to the first rocks I had seen in the river since
leaving the Tapajoz River. They were at the double
whirlpool of Naittavo. At the island of Errera was a
narrow channel only 30 to 40 m. wide, where the current
was extremely strong, and just deep enough for our
launch, which drew 5 ft. of water. The upstream
end of the island was strewn with logs of wood,
forming a kind of barrage, the water of the dividing
stream being thrown with great force against it. It
was here that we got the first sight of high mountains&mdash;a
great change after the immense stretches of flat land
we had encountered all along the Amazon, Solim&otilde;es
and Ucayalli. I saw some beautiful specimens of
the idle or sleepy monkey, the <i>preguya</i>, a nocturnal
animal with wonderful fur. The small launch was
swung about with great force from one side to the
other by the strong current and whirlpools. We
saw a number of <i>Cashibos</i> (Carapaches and Callisecas)
on the right bank of the river. They are said to be
cannibals, but personally I rather doubt it. If they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-433" id="Pg_2-433"></a>[<a href="images/2-433.png">433</a>]</span>
have occasionally eaten a missionary or two, I believe
that it must have been rather as a religious superstition
than because of the actual craving for human
flesh. Also it is possible that, as is the case with
many African tribes, the Cashibos may believe that
eating an enemy gives strength and courage, and
may have indulged in this practice purely on that
account. So that I do not think that it is fair to
call those Indians cannibals in the true sense of the
word, any more than it would be fair to call a teetotaller
a drunkard because he took a drink or two of brandy
for medicinal purposes.</p>

<p>The word "Cashibo" in the Pana language means
vampire. Those Indians are great fighters, and are
in a constant state of hostility with all their neighbours.
They are good hunters and fishermen. Their weapons
are well made, and consist of bow and arrows, spears
and war-clubs. The Callisecas and Carapaches are
very light in colour, with a yellowish skin, not darker
than that of the average Spaniard. They are fine-looking
people, fairly hairy on the face and body.
The men grow long beards. Men and women generally
go about naked, but some of the Indians near the
river have adopted long shawls in which they wrap
themselves. After marriage the women wear a loin-cloth,
but nothing at all before marriage. The girls
when young are attractive, with luminous, expressive,
dark brown eyes. These Cashibos are supposed to
be the "white race" of the Amazon. They are nevertheless
not white at all, but belong to a yellow race,
although they are, as I have said, of a light yellow
colour. Many yellow races have come under my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-434" id="Pg_2-434"></a>[<a href="images/2-434.png">434</a>]</span>
observation in the islands of the Pacific Ocean,
who were just as light as the Cashibos, such as
the Bilans and Manobos, and some who were even
whiter than they are, such as the Mansakas of the
Mindanao Island. The Cashibos are wild people, and
the settlers in the neighbourhood are much afraid of
them.</p>

<p>On January 13th, when we were three days out
from Masisea, we were travelling between high rocky
hills with almost vertical sides. Their section showed
in the lower portion narrow bands of violet-coloured
rock and white light stone in a horizontal stratum.
Above that had accumulated a deep layer from 30
to 100 ft. thick of red earth.</p>

<p>We went across a dangerous whirlpool. The
launch hardly had enough strength to pull through
at full speed. The water all around us formed great
circles with deep central hollows, and, as we went
through, rose before us like a wall. It had quite an
impressive effect. That particular whirlpool was
called Sheboya. Soon afterwards we obtained a
beautiful view of the high range&mdash;the Sira mountains.</p>

<p class="fsc">Wonderful Example of Old Spanish Wood-Carving, Peru.</p>
<hr />
<p>On January 14th we went over the whirlpool of
Marques, a most picturesque sight. On the banks
of the river was plenty of rubber, <i>hevea</i>, but not of
quite such good quality as that found in Brazil. Some
of the trees exuded white and some yellow latex,
the coloration being probably due to the quality of
the soil. There were few habitations along the banks
of the Pachitea River. There were tribes of the
Campas (or Antis) and Cashibos Indians, the members<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-435" id="Pg_2-435"></a>[<a href="images/2-435.png">435</a>]</span>
of both races having marked Malay characteristics.
Occasionally one met extraordinary people in those
out-of-the-way regions. When we halted for wood,
which we used instead of coal for our engine, a man
some six feet four inches in height came on board&mdash;quite
an extraordinary-looking person. To my amazement,
when I spoke to him, he turned out to be a man
of refined taste and quite highly educated. He was
a Hungarian count and an officer in the Austrian army,
who, having got into trouble in his own country, had
gone to settle there.</p>

<p>From a place called Cahaubanas, at the confluence
of the river Pichis with the Pachitea, it was possible
to cross over on foot to the Mayro, a stream which
flowed into the Palcazu, and in two more days' walking
(about 75 kil.), the German colony of Potzuzu could
be reached at the meeting-place of the Potzuzu River
with the Uancabamba. From the German colony
158 kil. more would bring you to Uanuco, and 138
kil. farther on was Serra de Pasco, whence the railway
went to Lima.</p>

<p>Another trail from Cahaubanas proceeded to
Chuchura, about 50 kil. higher up the Mayro river.
From there it was possible to cross the Yanachag
Mountains and reach the settlement of Uancabamba.
The distance from Cahaubanas to Chuchura was one
and a half day's walking&mdash;some 40 kil. of heavy
climbing, that from Chuchura to Uancabamba two
days' marching. From Uancabamba one was able to
get mules in order to go over the high pass of Culebra
Marca and reach Serra de Pasco.</p>

<p>It was possible by that trail to reach Lima in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-436" id="Pg_2-436"></a>[<a href="images/2-436.png">436</a>]</span>
few days on foot. It was out of the question for
me to attempt such a journey, the attack of beri-beri
in my right leg making it almost impossible for me
to stand up. I decided to go as far up the stream
as I could on the launch and by canoe.</p>

<p>At Cahaubanas were a monastery and a great
many Indians. After halting for the night at that
place we continued our journey up the Pachitea with
a strange medley of passengers on board. We had
the Hungarian count, an Italian farmer, who was a
remarkable musician and played the accordion beautifully;
we had some Peruvians, a Spanish emigrant, a
small Indian boy aged ten who acted as steward, and a
young fellow of German origin.</p>

<p>The cook on the launch was a lunatic, who was
under the impression that he was the Saviour. It
was too pathetic, and occasionally quite alarming, to
see the poor man leaving the cooking stove whenever
we passed any Indians on the banks, when he raised
his arms up in the air and, stretching them forward,
gave his benediction to the people he saw, instead of
looking after the boiling rice. His benedictions cost
him frequent kicks and shakings by the neck on the
part of the captain of the launch. He was absorbed
in fervent praying during the night. He seldom
condescended to speak to any of us on board, as he
said that he was not living on this earth, but would
come back some day to bring peace and happiness
to the whole world. Words of that kind were uttered
whilst he was holding a saucepan in one hand and
a ladle in the other. It was pathetic.</p>

<p>In pouring rain we left again on January 16th<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-437" id="Pg_2-437"></a>[<a href="images/2-437.png">437</a>]</span>
between the high rocky banks of the river, well padded
with earth and with dense vegetation. Extensive
beaches of grey sand and coarse gravel were passed,
until we arrived at Port Bermudez, situated at the
confluence of the Pichis with the Chibbis, a tributary
on the left bank. Here we found the last of the
chain of wireless stations which had three iron towers.
From that place a telephone and telegraph wire
have been installed right over the Andes and down to
Lima.</p>

<p>The passage on the Government launch from Masisea
to Bermudez cost &pound;7 10<i>s.</i> I heard there that, thanks
to the arrangements which had been made by the
Prefect of the Loreto Province, the number of mules
I required in order to cross the Andes was duly
waiting for me at the foot of that great chain of
mountains.</p>

<p>I therefore lost no time, and on January 17th,
having left the launch <i>Esploradora</i>, proceeded in a
canoe with all my baggage intending to navigate as
far as possible the river Pichis, a tributary of the
Pachitea, formed by the united Nazaratec and Asupizu
rivers.</p>

<p>The landscape was getting very beautiful, the
Sungaro Paro Mountains rising to a great height on
the south-west. Immense <i>lubuna</i> trees, not unlike
pines in shape, were the largest trees in that region&mdash;from
5 to 6 ft. in diameter. The current was so strong
that we were unable to reach the spot where the mules
were awaiting me, and I had to spend the night on
a gravel beach.</p>

<p>The next morning, however, January 18th, after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-438" id="Pg_2-438"></a>[<a href="images/2-438.png">438</a>]</span>
passing two small rapids, where my men had to go
into the water in order to pull the canoe through,
I arrived at Yessup, where my mules were awaiting
me, and where there was a <i>tambo</i> or rest-house, kept
beautifully clean.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Across the Andes&mdash;The End of the Trans-continental Journey</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> fortunate in obtaining some excellent Peruvian
muleteers to accompany me on the expedition over
the Andes. The trip might have been a rough one for
the ordinary traveller, but for me it was a real holiday
excursion, after the horrible time I had experienced in
Brazil. This notwithstanding the disagreeable weather
I encountered during the fourteen days' rough riding
which I employed in reaching the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>I started at once with my pack animals on the
trail which has been cut by the Peruvian Government
over the mountains. Rain came down in torrents.
Most of the country was swampy, the mules sinking
chest-deep in mud. The travelling was not exactly
what you would call pleasant. Your legs dangled
all the time in water and slush. As that trail was
used by caravans, the mules had cut regular transverse
grooves in the ground all along, in which successively
they all placed their hoofs. Each groove was filled
with slushy water, and was separated from the next
by a mud wall from one to three feet high. The
mules were constantly stumbling and falling. After
you had travelled a short distance you were in a
filthy condition, the torrential rain washing down the
splashes of mud and spreading them all over you.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-440" id="Pg_2-440"></a>[<a href="images/2-440.png">440</a>]</span>
After leaving Yessup we crossed first the Sinchhuaqui
river, then the Aguachini. We began to
ascend two kilometres after we had left Yessup, and
marched steadily the entire day among gigantic
<i>aguaso</i> trees and wonderful ferns of great height,
until we reached the Miriatiriami <i>tambo</i>, 27 kil. from
Yessup.</p>

<p>On January 19th we followed the River Azupizu
along a narrow trail from 300 to 400 ft. above the
level of the river, with an almost vertical drop by the
side of us. Huge palms and ferns of indescribable
beauty were to be seen all along, while waterfalls
and streamlets constantly crossed the trail.</p>

<p>We encountered that day deep mud all the way,
the mules sinking up to their bellies in the slush.
The trail along the mountain side was cut in the soft
earth, and actually formed a deep groove only about
two feet wide, the mud and slush being held by the
solid transverse barriers which succeeded one another
at short intervals.</p>

<hr />
<p>At Piriatingalini and Puchalini we found light
cable suspension bridges, very shaky, which swung
to and fro as you rode over them. Most of them
were not more than four feet wide and had no
parapet at all. I cannot say that I felt particularly
happy when my mule&mdash;sure-footed, I grant&mdash;took me
across, the bridge swinging, quivering, and squeaking
with our weight on it, especially when we were in the
middle. The rivers were extremely picturesque, with
high mountains on either side, among which they
wound their way in a snake-like fashion over a rocky
bed, forming a series of cascades. We went that day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-441" id="Pg_2-441"></a>[<a href="images/2-441.png">441</a>]</span>
25 kil., and arrived at the <i>tambo</i> of Azupizu, which
was in charge of a deserter from the French navy.
He was an extraordinary character. He had forgotten
French, and had neither learnt Spanish nor
the local language of the Campas Indians.</p>

<p>A tribe of those Indians was to be found near
there&mdash;very handsome people, the men solidly built
and muscular, with intelligent but brutal faces, with
the yellowish-brown skin and slanting eyes of the
Malay races. The eyes showed a great discoloration
in the upper part of the iris. They possessed straight
hair, slightly inclined to curl at the end. The nose
was flattened at the root. They wore a few ornaments
of feathers on the head. Their clothing consisted of
a loose gown not unlike a Roman toga. The women
were good-looking when very young.</p>

<p>The Campas claimed to be the direct descendants
of the Incas. There is no doubt that the Campas
were practically the same tribe as the Antis, once a
most powerful tribe which inhabited an extensive
territory to the north and east of Cuzco. In fact,
the eastern portion of the Inca country was once
called Anti-Suya. The Campas, or Antis, were
formerly ferocious. They are now quite tame, but
still retain their cruel countenances, resembling closely
those of Polynesians and Malays.</p>

<p>We left that place on January 20th in drenching
rain. The river was much swollen, and formed a
whirlpool of great magnitude just over some bad
rapids. We crossed from mountain-side to mountain-side,
some 400 ft. above the stream, in a sling car
running along a wire rope. The car consisted of two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-442" id="Pg_2-442"></a>[<a href="images/2-442.png">442</a>]</span>
planks suspended on four pieces of telegraph wire.
As the sling had been badly constructed it did not
run smoothly along the cable. I had an unpleasant
experience&mdash;everybody had who used that conveyance&mdash;as
I was going across from one side to the other
of the stream, a distance of some 200 metres or more.
The ropes which were used for pulling the car along
got badly entangled when I had reached the middle
of the passage. The Indians and the Frenchman
pulled with violent jerks in order to disentangle them,
and caused the car to swing and bump to such an
extent that it was all I could do to hold on and not
be flung out of it. Having been swung to and fro
for the best part of an hour on that primitive arrangement,
I was able to proceed on the other side of the
stream. Fortunately we had taken the precaution of
making the animals cross over the river the previous
evening, before it was in flood, or else we should have
been held up there for several days. Leaving the
Azupizu river, we followed the river Kintoliani, which
joined the Azupizu and formed with it a most formidable
stream.</p>

<p class="fsc">A Famous Inca Wall, Cuzco.</p>
<p class="figcenter">The various rocks fit so perfectly that no mortar was used to keep them in place.</p>
<hr />
<p>The trail was at a great height, some 600 ft. above
the water. In two or three places where it had been
cut into the rock it was most dangerous, as the rocks
were slippery with the wet, so that the mules had
great difficulty in keeping their feet. The vegetation
was wonderful, with trees of enormous height and
beautiful giant palms. Waterfalls over rocky walls
were plentiful, while the effects of clouds were marvellous
among those mountains&mdash;although my enthusiasm
was damped a good deal that day by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-443" id="Pg_2-443"></a>[<a href="images/2-443.png">443</a>]</span>
torrential rain, which came down in bucketfuls upon
us, and filtered through even my heavy waterproof
coat.</p>

<p>The zigzag ascent was extremely heavy, the first
part being over rocky ground, while the rest of that
day's journey was along a swampy trail on which
the mules stumbled and fell many times. One of
my men had a narrow escape from being precipitated
down the chasm. So bad, indeed, was the trail that
we only went 15 kil., halting at the <i>tambo</i> of Pampas
S. Nicolas.</p>

<p>On January 21st we made a long and tedious
march, rising all the time among slippery rocks along
precipices, or sinking in swampy mud on the narrow
trail. Picturesque waterfalls of great height were
visible in volcanic vents, some square, others crescent-shaped,
on the face of the mountain. The torrents,
swollen by the heavy rains, were difficult to cross, my
mules on several occasions being nearly swept away
by the foaming current. We sank in deep red slush
and in deep holes filled with water, but continued all
the time to ascend a gentle but continuous incline.
We travelled that day from six o'clock in the morning
until six o'clock in the evening, rain pouring down
upon us all the time. We were simply smothered in
mud from head to foot.</p>

<p>We found a large <i>tambo</i> at Camp 93, with a telephone
and telegraph station. At those <i>tambos</i> it was
always possible to obtain rice, chickens and eggs at
reasonable prices, fixed by the Government. In many
of the <i>tambos</i> were also rough wooden bedsteads, with
a more or less comfortable mattress. I generally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-444" id="Pg_2-444"></a>[<a href="images/2-444.png">444</a>]</span>
preferred to use my own camp-bed. As there were
never more than one or two rooms in the <i>tambo</i>, you
had to sleep in the same room with other people,
unless you preferred to sleep outside, as I did.</p>

<p>For the privilege of sleeping at any <i>tambo</i>, in or
out of doors, one paid the small sum of one shilling.
A dinner or lunch seldom cost more than two shillings,
and breakfast eightpence to one shilling. The food
for the animals could be reckoned at one shilling for
each mule, the price being higher at the Yessup end
of the journey and getting gradually lower as one
got nearer the capital.</p>

<p>Of course one could not call travelling over the
Andes in any way luxurious. The tablecloths at the
<i>tambos</i> showed all round the table the marks of
the dirty lips of previous travellers, and plentiful stains
of soup, coffee and tea. The illumination consisted
usually of a candle placed in the mouth of a bottle,
which was used as a candlestick.</p>

<p>I saw more Campas Indians there. They were
singing songs strongly resembling Malay melodies,
to the accompaniment of Spanish guitars. Other
songs influenced by Spanish airs, but still delivered
in a typically Malay fashion, were also given that
evening. They interested me greatly.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill2-444.jpg"><img src="images/ill2-444_th.jpg" alt="Inca Three-Walled Fortress of Sacsayhuaman, Cuzco." title="Inca Three-Walled Fortress of Sacsayhuaman, Cuzco." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Inca Three-Walled Fortress of Sacsayhuaman, Cuzco.</p>
<hr />
<p>On January 22nd we left Camp 93. I was struck
everywhere at those <i>tambos</i> by the great honesty of
the Peruvians. I was often touched by the extreme
kindness of the people and their considerate manner&mdash;although
perhaps it was more particularly striking
to me after my experience of the brutal behaviour
of the lower-class Brazilians. The gentle way of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-445" id="Pg_2-445"></a>[<a href="images/2-445.png">445</a>]</span>
speaking, the more harmonious language&mdash;Spanish
instead of Portuguese&mdash;and the charming civility of
the people, made travelling, even under those unpleasant
circumstances, quite agreeable.</p>

<p>It was cold, especially at night. Nearly all my
instruments had been badly damaged in our many
accidents in Brazil, and I was unable to replace them
either in Par&aacute; or Manaos. Owing, therefore, to the
lack of self-registering thermometers, I could not
keep an accurate daily record of the maximum and
minimum temperatures. After leaving Camp 93, we
went over a really fearful trail, my mules being all
the time chest-deep in mud. It was extremely hard
work for the animals to get along. As is well known
to any traveller, all animals of a caravan when on a
narrow path step in the footprints of their predecessors,
so that on that trail they had sunk a long series of
deep holes in the soft clay, which were constantly
being filled by water sliding from the mountain-side.
In that particular part the mud had highly
caustic qualities, which burnt the skin and caused
irritation each time you were splashed. The muleteers
who were walking had their feet badly burnt by it,
one man suffering agony from his blistered feet.</p>

<p>Magnificent mountain scenery covered with luxuriant
forest surrounded us as the trail wound its
way along the high point on the top of the mountain
range. We went only 21 kil. that day from Pampas,
having occupied seven hours to cover the distance,
owing to the difficulties of the march.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we were enveloped in dense fog
which lasted the whole night, the cold being quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-446" id="Pg_2-446"></a>[<a href="images/2-446.png">446</a>]</span>
severe, and the more perceptible because of the
humidity in the air. The trail here described a wide
detour, which could have easily been avoided had
another trail that went direct to New Bermudez been
followed at the bottom of the valley. The journey
by that lower trail could be accomplished in one day
and a half. The elevation by hypsometrical apparatus
of this camp (N.71) was 5,663 ft.</p>

<p>On January 23rd we descended rapidly through
beautiful forest from Camp 71, where we had halted
for the night, to a large <i>tambo</i> called Ene&ntilde;as, in charge
of an Italian. The place was situated in a beautiful
valley intersected by a streamlet saturated with lime.
It looked exactly like milk, and hurt your gums
considerably when you drank it. The excellent
mule I was riding had unfortunately hurt one of its
legs while we were crossing a swollen torrent, where
the mule and myself were nearly swept away in the
foaming current. Riding on the lame animal, which
was all the time stumbling and falling down on its
knees, was unpleasant. In the narrow trail it was
not possible to unload another animal and change
the saddle, and it was out of the question for me to
walk.</p>

<hr />
<p>I arrived at the <i>tambo</i> with a ravenous appetite,
but unfortunately nobody had telephoned from the
previous <i>tambo</i> that I was coming, so that it was
impossible to get lunch, and I had to wait two or
three hours before I could get anything to eat at all.
The men in charge of the various <i>tambos</i> were rather
negligent in telephoning and making arrangements
with the next <i>tambo</i>, as the kind of travellers they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-447" id="Pg_2-447"></a>[<a href="images/2-447.png">447</a>]</span>
had on that trail was not of the highest type and
could not always be relied upon for payment. The
people in charge of the <i>tambos</i> were poor devils, half
<i>abrutis</i>, to use a most appropriate French expression,
by the life they had to lead in that forlorn country.</p>

<p>On January 24th we continued our journey over
horrible deep mud-holes, which made the trail extremely
dangerous. On that particular day we were
travelling over sticky soil, so that when the mules
trod in the deep holes they stuck with their hoofs
and fell over, immediately struggling wildly to free
themselves. One of my men was nearly thrown
down a precipice that day, and all of us, as well as
all the pack animals, had many unpleasant falls during
that march. Swampy places like that were encountered
for hundreds of metres at a time. In one place
that day we had two kilometres of continuous swampy
mud. In the afternoon I had a nasty fall, the mule
rolling right on the top of me and nearly breaking my
right leg. The animal in falling had sunk its head
in the sticky mud, and was struggling madly to release
itself. The animals were then marching chest-deep
in mud. In my helpless condition I tried to get off
when the animal fell, but sank up to my waist and
stuck fast with my legs in the mud. When the mule
rolled over, it knocked me down on the edge of the
precipice, my leg remaining caught under the animal.
Had not one of my muleteers been by my side at
the moment and rushed to my rescue, I should have
fared badly indeed.</p>

<p>We had a slippery descent after Tambo 33, where
we had a lunch composed of putrid tinned salmon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-448" id="Pg_2-448"></a>[<a href="images/2-448.png">448</a>]</span>
and "invisible" eggs&mdash;the latter dish being a speciality
of that place. The <i>tambo</i> man insisted that I had eaten
six eggs, whereas I had not even seen them except
on the bill. He told me that I was wrong, showing me
a napkin on which two yellow streaks were to be seen&mdash;though
not left there by me, but by the lips of some
traveller who had passed perhaps a month before.</p>

<p>We made a long march that day, having left at
seven o'clock in the morning, and arriving at our
halting-place at four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The next day, January 25th, we had a trying
march. Several land-slides had taken place, bringing
down great patches of forest. Numberless trees had
fallen over, making it difficult for the animals to be
taken across. In one place all of them had to be
unloaded, and they sank so deeply in the slush and
soft earth that we had three or four hours' extremely
hard work to cover a distance of about 50 m. The
animals became so scared that they would not go on
at all. The men who pushed and led them along
that dangerous passage with a deep precipice on one
side were in constant danger.</p>

<p>The rain, which had been torrential during the
night, continued during the entire day, swelling the
streams and making them most difficult to cross.
In one stream my mule and I were swept away
altogether. I had water right up to my waist while
riding, and the mule showed only its head above
the water. We were thrown with great force against
some rocks, where, fortunately, my muleteers came to
our help and got us out again.</p>

<hr />
<p>The trail&mdash;about half a metre wide&mdash;wound its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-449" id="Pg_2-449"></a>[<a href="images/2-449.png">449</a>]</span>
way up to a great height above the foaming river.
There were beautiful ferns of immense height, some
of which had finely ribbed, gigantic leaves. Graceful
yellow flowers, or sometimes beautiful red ones, were
to be seen on tall trees with white, clean stems.
We passed a coffee plantation, owned by English people,
near a charming settlement of whitewashed houses
on the opposite side of the river. When we came
to cross the Rio Las Palmas&mdash;heavily swollen&mdash;we
were once more nearly swept away in riding across
with water up to our chests. The baggage naturally
suffered a good deal in those constant immersions.
This was, unfortunately, the wrong season for crossing
the Andes; but I could not help that, as I was anxious
to get through, and could not wait for the fine weather
to come.</p>

<p>Farther on we crossed the river Paucartambo
near the Pueblo Pardo. We next followed the Rio
Chanchamayo, which afterwards became the Rio
Perene, along which extensive English farms had been
established. We were now getting near to civilization.
I felt that my work was entirely finished, as the
country hereabouts was well known.</p>

<p>We came to the Colorado river, a tributary of
the Chanchamayo, and passed S. Luiz de Shuaro, a
charming little village of whitewashed houses. The
scenery was beautiful on nearing La Merced. The
river basin showed luxuriant grassy slopes and immense
sugar plantations.</p>

<p>La Merced was situated on the left bank of the
Rio Chanchamayo, formed by the meeting of the Rio
Tulumayo and the Rio Tarma, which joined near the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-450" id="Pg_2-450"></a>[<a href="images/2-450.png">450</a>]</span>
village of S. Ramon. It had two modest hotels and
various commercial houses. In a way I was sorry
to get to a town again, because in those places you
had all the trumpery illusion of civilization without
any of its real advantages. One met, however, with
the greatest civility from everybody, and, indeed,
with the greatest honesty. So that travelling in
those regions was quite a pleasure.</p>

<p>To my amazement that evening a burly Italian
came into the hotel. Who was he?&mdash;Garibaldi's
grandson, the son of General Canzio and Garibaldi's
daughter. He was interested in some mines in the
district, and had lived there for some years trying
to make a fortune.</p>

<p>What impressed one most in the settlements on
the Andes were the great neatness and cleanliness of
all the buildings, and the charming manners of all
the people one met. Everybody, without exception,
saluted you politely as you approached; everybody
was anxious to be of assistance or offer you hospitality.
There was, nevertheless, nothing of great interest in
those high-placed villages.</p>

<p>On January 26th I went on in a drenching rain,
having changed my animals at that place for another
lot of excellent mules. The hire of animals was somewhat
high, but after the prices one had to pay in
Brazil, everything seemed, by comparison, dirt-cheap
in Peru. I also said good-bye to the Peruvians who
had accompanied me so far, and employed Indians
to take charge of my animals.</p>

<p>From La Merced there was a trail from one to
three metres wide, cut out in the solid rock and skirting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-451" id="Pg_2-451"></a>[<a href="images/2-451.png">451</a>]</span>
all along the foaming river, which flowed in the
opposite direction from that in which we were travelling.
In several places narrow tunnels had been excavated
in the rock, through which the trail proceeded. These
tunnels were dangerous when you encountered caravans
of pack animals coming through from the opposite
direction. The animals often got jammed in the
middle of the tunnel, tearing their loads to pieces in
their attempts to disentangle themselves. Once I got
jammed myself, and came out minus a patch of skin
several inches long from my left shin and knee.</p>

<p>Between La Merced and S. Ramon, a distance
of some 10 kil., one had to cross the shaky suspension
bridges of La Herreria and S. Ramon. The oscillations
of those bridges were so great that it was always a
marvel to me that the animals and riders were not
precipitated into the river below. The planks of the
bridges were in many places so rotten that it was
not uncommon for the animals to put their legs right
through them. Only one animal at a time could go
across, as the bridges were not strong enough to
support more.</p>

<p>Farther on we arrived at two more bridges&mdash;the
Puntayacu and the Rio Seco, one a suspension bridge,
the other built of masonry. One met hundreds of
Indians upon the trail, in costumes resembling those
of the Calabrese of Italy. The men wore heavy
woollen hand-knitted stockings up to their knees, or
else over their trousers, white leggings left open
behind as far down as the knee. Round felt hats were
worn by the women, who were garbed in bright blue
or red petticoats, very full and much pleated, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-452" id="Pg_2-452"></a>[<a href="images/2-452.png">452</a>]</span>
quite short. Red was the favourite colour for the
shawl which they threw round the body and over the
shoulders.</p>

<p>When we proceeded the next morning the heat
in the low valley was stifling. The scenery continued
to be beautiful, with magnificent waterfalls and torrents
flowing down at a steep angle among rocks.</p>

<p>I stopped for the night at the charming little
hotel of Huacapistana, situated at a lower level than
the road in a most picturesque narrow valley, on the
right bank of the Tarma River. The distance between
La Merced and Huacapistana was about 35 kil.</p>

<p>Between Huacapistana and Tarma the track was
excellent. We went through the Carpapata tunnel,
184 m. long&mdash;very dark and narrow, and extremely
dangerous if you happened to meet pack animals in
the middle. The scenery was enchanting and the
vegetation wonderful until, 20 kil. farther, I entered,
by a magnificent avenue of eucalyptus trees, the most
picturesque town of the higher Andes, Tarma. The
narrow, neat streets were paved with cobble-stones.
All the houses were painted white, and had red-tiled
roofs. The streets swarmed with quaintly attired
Indians and tidily dressed Peruvians. There were
many Italians and Spaniards in Tarma. Two or three
hotels existed here&mdash;a capital one, actually lighted by
electric light, being kept by a most honest Italian.
The elevation of Tarma, taken by the hypsometrical
apparatus, was 10,034 ft.</p>

<p class="fsc">Entrance to Inca Subterranean Passages.</p>
<hr />
<p>I left Tarma on January 29th, following a well-cultivated
valley, fairly thickly inhabited. We were
travelling over a good mule-track, swarming with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-453" id="Pg_2-453"></a>[<a href="images/2-453.png">453</a>]</span>
Indians, donkeys, mules, and horses. The mud houses
and land on either side were enclosed by hedges of
cacti, or by walls. We were between barren mountains
of a brownish colour, against which the quaint,
brightly-coloured costumes of the many people on
the road were thrown out in vivid contrast. Most
of the houses were constructed of large mud bricks,
sun-dried. The crops seemed to consist chiefly of
Indian corn. As we went farther, among dark brown
rocks and limestone, we came to grottoes and rock
habitations. At some remote period there must have
been a great upheaval in that country&mdash;at least,
judging by the sedimentary foliated rock, the strata
of which were from one to three feet thick, and which
had originally been deposited horizontally by water.
These accumulations or sediments now stood up at an
angle of 45&deg;. We were now in a region where llamas
were plentiful&mdash;most delightful animals, with their
pointed ears pricked up, their luxuriant coats, and
stumpy curled tails.</p>

<p>We came to a steep ascent over a high pass, where
the cold wind was fierce. On reaching the pass I
found myself on a grassy plateau in which were to
be seen two circles of stones by the side of each
other.</p>

<p>The partition of the waters flowing into the River
Mantaro and the River Tarma took place at the point
called Ricran, not far from the high pass we had
crossed. It was always advisable when taking the
journey between Tarma and Oroya to start early in
the morning, so as to be on that pass before noon.
In the afternoon the wind was intensely cold and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-454" id="Pg_2-454"></a>[<a href="images/2-454.png">454</a>]</span>
frequently accompanied by violent storms of hail
and rain.</p>

<p>I arrived in the evening at Oroya, the distance
from Tarma being 30 kil. 236 m. The journey between
the two places could be accomplished on a good mule
in five or six hours. Oroya was an important point
for me, as it was there that I saw the first railway
since leaving Araguary in Brazil nearly a year before.</p>

<p>Oroya is perhaps one of the highest railway stations
in the world, its accurate elevation by boiling-point
thermometers being 12,156 ft.</p>

<p>The town, like all termini of railway lines, was not
an attractive place. There were two or three hotels,
all extremely bad. One began to feel the effects of
civilization in the dishonesty of the people.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, thanks to arrangements
made by Mr. D. T. Lee, I was allowed to take the
journey to Lima in a "gravity car," in the company
of the engineer, Mr. Beverley R. Mayer, instead of
by the usual train, which ran twice a week. Of
course it was only possible to go by "gravity car"
from the highest point of the railway, which is not at
Oroya, but at the tunnel of Galera, 5,356 m. (17,572 ft.)
above the sea-level as measured by the railway
surveyors.</p>

<p>The scenery was magnificent on that railway.
Having gone through the Galera tunnel, Mr. Mayer
and I got on the small "gravity car," keeping all
the time just in front of the train. It was quite an
exciting journey, the incline being so great that we
soon acquired a vertiginous speed&mdash;in fact, too much,
because our brakes would not act any more. With<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-455" id="Pg_2-455"></a>[<a href="images/2-455.png">455</a>]</span>
the snow and rain the rails had become so slippery
that we went sliding down at the most alarming pace.
Nor did I feel particularly happy at having the train
only a few hundred metres behind us. Whenever we
got to a station, we had to get off quickly and get
our car off the rails to give room to the incoming
train. The cold was intense.</p>

<p>The geological formation of the Andes in that
particular region was remarkable, and more remarkable
still was the British engineering triumph of
constructing a railway from the sea to so high an
elevation. In one or two places there were iron bridges
of great height and ingenious construction. You felt
a curious sensation as you flew over those bridges on
the tiny car, and you saw between the rails the chasm
underneath you; nor did you feel extraordinarily
comfortable when, hundreds of feet down, down
below, at the bottom of one chasm, you saw a railway
engine which had leapt the rails and lay upside
down in the middle of a foaming torrent.</p>

<p>Naturally, in building a mountain railway of that
type, a great many curves and zigzags were necessary,
many of those curves taking place inside tunnels.
Along the railway rivers have been switched off through
tunnels within the mountain, and produced picturesque
cascades where they came out again.</p>

<p>The geological surprises were continual. Next to
mountains with perfectly horizontal strata you saw
other mountains with strata in a vertical position,
especially in the limestone formation. Farther down
immense superposed terraces were to be noticed upon
the mountain side, evidently made by the ancient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-456" id="Pg_2-456"></a>[<a href="images/2-456.png">456</a>]</span>
dwellers of that country for the cultivation of their
inhospitable land.</p>

<p>This interested me greatly. I had seen among
the Igorrotes or head-hunters of the island of Luzon,
in the Philippine Archipelago, that same method of
irrigation, by collecting the water from a high point
on the mountain side in order to irrigate consecutively
the series of terraces. Not only was I struck by the
fact of finding so unusual a method of cultivation at
two points of the globe so far apart, but I was even
more impressed by the wonderful resemblance in type
between the local natives and the inhabitants of the
northern island of the Philippines. Undoubtedly these
people came from the same stock.</p>

<p>Where we stopped at the different stations there
was always something interesting to observe&mdash;now
the hundreds of llamas which had conveyed goods
to the railway; at one place the numberless sacks of
ore waiting to be taken to the coast; at another
the tall active chimneys of the smelters, which
suggested industry on a large scale. I took a number
of photographs under difficulties on that journey down
the Andes.</p>

<p>At 7.30 p.m. on January 30th, 1912, I arrived
safely at Lima, a distance of 222 kil. from Oroya.
The total distance from Iquitos to Lima over the
Andes was 2,079 kil., which distance I had performed
in the record time of one month, the time generally
occupied by the usual travellers being from fifty to
seventy days.</p>

<p class="fsc">Inca Remains near Cuzco.</p>
<hr />
<p>From Lima I proceeded early the next morning
to Callao, the port for Lima, a few kilometres farther,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-457" id="Pg_2-457"></a>[<a href="images/2-457.png">457</a>]</span>
where at La Punta I touched the Pacific Ocean, thus
ending my trans-continental journey from Rio de
Janeiro, with its zigzags and deviations, 22,000 kil.
in length, or 13,750 miles.</p>

<p>I was already in better health when I reached
Lima. The violent changes of climate from the hot
valley of the Amazon to the snows of the Andes,
and from there to the sea-coast, had had a beneficial
effect upon me. The attack of beri-beri from which
I had been suffering was gradually passing away, my
right foot, by the time I reached Lima, having slowly
got back almost to its normal size, although my toes
were still atrophied. It is well known that there is
no better cure for beri-beri than sea air.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lima</span> is a beautiful city, as everybody knows. Its
wonderful churches, its clean streets, its commerce,
the great charm of the people&mdash;indeed, the Peruvians
are the most cultivated and polished people in South
America, and the women the most beautiful&mdash;make
it one of the most attractive cities I visited on that
continent.</p>

<p>I was, nevertheless, anxious to return quickly to
Europe. I had no strength left. The mental strain
on that long journey had been so great that I had
lost my memory altogether.</p>

<p>Owing to the great kindness of the British Minister,
Mr. C. des Graz, and of Mr. Mockill, the chief of the
Peruvian Corporation at Lima, arrangements were
made for me to travel in luxurious comfort through
the country of the Incas&mdash;so that, although terribly
exhausted, I decided to take a further journey in the
interior of Peru, Bolivia, and Chile.</p>

<p>I left Lima five days after my arrival, on February
5th, going by steamer to the port of Mollendo, where
I arrived on February 7th. There I met the railway
line of the Peruvian Corporation from the sea coast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-459" id="Pg_2-459"></a>[<a href="images/2-459.png">459</a>]</span>
to Arequipa and Cuzco. A magnificent private car
had been placed at my disposal by the Peruvian
Corporation, in which I was able to make myself
comfortable for the several days which the journey
lasted. Not only so, but the Peruvian Corporation
kindly looked after my welfare in a most thoughtful
way during the whole time I travelled on their
line, for which I am indeed extremely grateful, as the
travelling in that country would have otherwise been
less pleasant.</p>

<p>The railroad from Mollendo went along the coast
among curious eroded rocks of great interest; then
gradually left the sea among sand-dunes and mounds
upon the wide beach.</p>

<p>As the railway began to get higher and higher
upon the steep gradient the scenery became more
and more beautiful. Presently we found ourselves
overlooking a wonderful flat valley between two high
hill ranges in lovely green patches, cut with geometrical
precision, and well cultivated. Giant cacti
of the candelabrum type were plentiful. Farther on
we got upon an elevated plateau with a white surface
of pumice-stone, followed by red volcanic sand&mdash;an
immense stretch of country surrounded by low hills
of grey tufa and red volcanic rock.</p>

<p>Beyond that we came to a most interesting region
of sand-dunes of extraordinary shapes, where the
under soil was of a brilliant red, while the sand
accumulations were of a grey colour. Some of the
dunes were crescent-shaped. They stood usually in
sets or rows extending from north-west to south-east.
Then there were high mounds, also of sand, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-460" id="Pg_2-460"></a>[<a href="images/2-460.png">460</a>]</span>
dunes of all kinds, some with a double crescent,
or with the inside of the crescent much indented,
others with multiple concave curves. The concavity
of all those dunes was on the north-east side.</p>

<p>I had seen a similar formation of dunes in the
Salt Desert of Persia; also in the south-western desert
of Afghanistan and in the northern desert of Beluchistan;
but I do not remember ever having seen such
a perfect formation of dunes as that to be seen in
this part of Peru.</p>

<p>Beyond that sandy zone we had before us a red
plateau with fluted sides. Great mounds of blackened
volcanic sand were quite frequent, the railway winding
its way around immense basins formed by depressions
in the land. Then we entered a beautiful green narrow
valley along a streamlet intersecting the plateau.</p>

<p>From Mollendo the railway gradually rose to an
elevation of 2,301 m. (7,549 ft.) at Arequipa, where
I remained for the night.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/ill2-460.jpg"><img src="images/ill2-460_th.jpg" alt="The Great Inca Ruins of Viraccocha, in Tinta (Cuzco)." title="The Great Inca Ruins of Viraccocha, in Tinta (Cuzco)." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">The Great Inca Ruins of Viraccocha, in Tinta (Cuzco).</p>
<hr />
<p>Arequipa was an interesting city with its picturesque
arcades, its magnificent church of Spanish architecture
with marvellous ancient wood carvings, and its prettily-laid-out
gardens. I visited the astronomical observatory
of Harvard College, a few miles from the town,
where excellent work is being done in star photography
from that eminently suitable spot for the study of
the sky. The observatory was situated at an elevation
of 8,060 ft. It worked in conjunction with the Harvard
observatory in North America. By having thus one
station north and another south of the equator, the
observations made by that institution included the
stars in all parts of the sky from the North to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-461" id="Pg_2-461"></a>[<a href="images/2-461.png">461</a>]</span>
South Pole. A 24-inch Bruce photographic telescope,
a 13-inch Boyden telescope, an 8-inch Bache telescope,
and a 4-inch meridian photometer were the principal
instruments used at the Arequipa station.</p>

<p>I left Arequipa on the morning of February 9th,
going through country of volcanic tufa and red sand,
with immense furrows quite devoid of vegetation.
Occasionally we came upon great masses of boulders
cast by some volcanic force upon the surface of tufa
and sand. Then the railway gracefully climbed in
great curves over a plateau nearly 14,000 ft. high,
where tufts of grass could be seen, giving a greenish
appearance to the landscape.</p>

<p>We travelled along that great table-land, occasionally
seeing a herd of llamas stampede away at the
approach of the train, now and then observing circular
stone walls erected by shepherds as shelters. A
gable-roofed hut was occasionally seen. Picturesque
natives in their <i>ponchos</i> and red or yellow scarves
gazed, astonished, at the train throbbing along slowly
upon the steep gradient of that elevated barren
country. The cold seemed intense after the tropical
heat of Lima. It was snowing hard. In the daytime
I generally travelled seated in front of the engine,
in order to have a better view of the landscape. In
the train everybody suffered from <i>soroche</i> or mountain-sickness,
which attacked most people when brought
up quickly by the railway from the sea to such high
elevations. I was driven away from the front of the
engine by the cold rain and sleet beating with great
force into my face, and obscuring the landscape to
such an extent that I could see nothing at all.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-462" id="Pg_2-462"></a>[<a href="images/2-462.png">462</a>]</span>
When it cleared up we were travelling in a region
of marshes and pools in the lowest point of depressions,
then along a magnificent lake with green and brown
fantastically-shaped mountains and hills in the foreground,
and a high snowy range in the background.
The effects of light when the storm was raging over
the lake, with its conical and semi-spherical islands
dotting the water, were intensely picturesque.</p>

<p>After that the plateau became less interesting.
We descended gradually some 400 m. (1,312 ft.) to
the junction of Juliaca, 3,825 m. (12,550 ft.) above
the sea level.</p>

<p>At that place the luxurious car which had taken
me there had to be switched off from the Puno Line
to the Cuzco Line.</p>

<p>I had dinner in the hotel, and again was impressed
by the great honesty of the Peruvian people in the
interior, and their considerate manners. It was somewhat
curious to see the Indian waiter&mdash;most clumsy,
dressed up in uncomfortable and ill-fitting European
clothes&mdash;waiting on a medley of strange passengers, such
as red-faced Spanish priests, tidy, smooth, oily-haired
Peruvians, and talkative commercial travellers. But all&mdash;whether
fat or lean, rich or poor, Indian or Peruvian&mdash;were
the essence of politeness and thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>Being able to sleep in the luxurious car, where
I had two good bedrooms, my own kitchen, and a
sitting-room, I was indeed extremely comfortable.</p>

<p>I left again on February 10th over a great flat
grassy tableland, with hills terraced up for cultivation.
We passed an old church with a wonderful dome,
and behind it snow-capped blue mountains.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-463" id="Pg_2-463"></a>[<a href="images/2-463.png">463</a>]</span>
The women wore peculiar hats with flapping edges
in order to protect their faces from the wind. A black
cloth was generally worn over the women's heads
under the hat, while over their shoulders hung dark
green or purple <i>ponchos</i>.</p>

<p>The Indians of that region showed remarkably strong
Malay features.</p>

<p>The train steamed through the wide grassy valley,
once crossing a fairly large stream. High snowy
peaks loomed against the sky on our right, while we
were travelling all the time at elevations varying from
3,531 m. (11,584 ft.) at Sicuani to 4,313 m. (14,150 ft.)
at La Raya. The cold seemed intense. I got quite
frozen sitting on the engine.</p>

<p>Quantities of llamas and sheep grazing were now
to be seen on the land, foot-passengers and horsemen
crossing the valley in all directions. At the stations
large crowds of picturesque women squatted down
selling pottery and fruit.</p>

<p>The farther we got into the interior the more
picturesque the hats became. The women there wore
hats with rectangular gold-braided brims, and with
white, red or blue curtains at the sides. The men
had pointed woollen caps with ear-flaps. The women
were garbed in ample pleated skirts. Curiously
enough, while the head and body were so well protected,
most of them had bare legs and feet, the skirts
reaching only just below the knee.</p>

<p>Near villages one saw neat patches of land
turned, with trouble, into vegetable gardens. Stone
enclosures were used by the natives as shelters for
the animals during storms and to pen them up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-464" id="Pg_2-464"></a>[<a href="images/2-464.png">464</a>]</span>
at night. The people themselves lived in stone
huts.</p>

<p>The country reminded me forcibly of Tibet, and
so, in a way, did the people&mdash;short and stumpy and
smothered in clothes. I frequently noticed cairns
of stones like the <i>obos</i> typical of Tibet and of the
Himahlyas. There, too, as in Tibet, it seemed the
fashion for passers-by to place a white stone on those
cairns in order to bring good luck.</p>

<p>The men were curiously garbed in short, wide
white woollen trouserettes, reaching just below the
knees and split behind just over the calf. Under
those they wore another pair of trousers, slightly
longer. Their coats were short and tight, resembling
Eton jackets. They wore wide and much embroidered
belts, red and blue being their favourite colours.</p>

<p>An accident had happened to a bridge. It had
collapsed, so that the trains could not proceed. Thanks
to the great thoughtfulness of Mr. Mockill and his
inspector of the line, Mr. Blaisdell, another private
car, equally comfortable, had been sent down from
Cuzco to the bridge. My baggage was transferred
on men's backs to the opposite side of the stream.
With the delay of only an hour or so I was able to
proceed on another train to Cuzco, where I arrived
that same evening.</p>

<p>The city of Cuzco is situated at an elevation of
11,062 ft. above the sea level. In its vicinity the
most important remains of Inca civilization have
been found. The city itself was most interesting. Its
handsome Spanish cathedral had a fa&ccedil;ade of beautifully
designed columns and a fine central doorway.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-465" id="Pg_2-465"></a>[<a href="images/2-465.png">465</a>]</span>
The great bell in one of the towers contained a
large quantity of gold in the bronze, giving wonderful
resonance to its vibrating notes. A solid silver altar
of great height was to be admired in the interior
of the cathedral, while the chancel was of marvellously
carved wood. So was a supplementary altar which
had been stored away behind the silver one.</p>

<p>The principal square of Cuzco had recently been
paved with cement, on which none of the natives
could be induced to walk, as they were afraid of slipping,
accustomed as they were to the roughest cobble-stone
paving of their streets. Only the gentry of the
city could be seen treading with great care on the
polished pavement, and were looked upon with much
admiration by the lower natives, who stared aghast
from the porticoes around the square. In the centre
of the square was a cheap terra-cotta statue of the
Indian hero Atahualpa surmounting a fountain painted
of a ghastly green. The gardens were nicely laid
out with pretty lawns. Another beautiful church rose
in the <i>plaza</i>, the doorway of which was also handsome,
but not comparable in beauty with that of the cathedral.
The stone carvings of its fa&ccedil;ade were nevertheless
remarkable. There were arcades on three sides of
the <i>plaza</i>, the houses being generally only one storey
high above them. The buildings were painted light
blue, pink, green, or bright yellow, the columns of
beautifully cut stone being also covered with hideous
paint to match.</p>

<p>Thanks to the kindness of the President of the
Republic, Mr. B. B. Legujia, a telegram had been sent
asking the Prefect of Cuzco to give me every possible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-466" id="Pg_2-466"></a>[<a href="images/2-466.png">466</a>]</span>
assistance in visiting the Inca ruins in the neighbourhood.
The Prefect, Mr. J. J. V. Cu&ntilde;er, kindly placed
at my disposal three excellent horses and an orderly.</p>

<p>It is seldom one can visit a place where the people
have more primitive habits than in the city of Cuzco.
The streets, so wonderfully picturesque, were not
fit to walk upon. The people threw into them all
that can be thrown out of the houses, which possess
no sanitary arrangements of any kind. Much of the
pleasure of looking at the magnificent Inca walls&mdash;constructed
of great blocks of stone so well fitted
that no cement was necessary to hold them together&mdash;was
really lost through being absolutely stifled by
the suffocating odour which was everywhere prevalent
in Cuzco.</p>

<p>The photographs that are reproduced in the illustrations
of this book will give an idea of the grandeur
of the Inca works better than any description. As
I intend to produce at a later date a special work
on that country, I am unable here to go fully into
the history of the marvellous civilization of that
race.</p>

<p>A photograph will be seen in one of the illustrations
showing the immensity of the three-walled fortress
of Sacsayhuaman. Another photograph will show
with what accuracy the Incas could carve stone&mdash;which,
mind you, in those days must have been much
softer than it is now, and not unlike the sandstone
that is used in England for building purposes.</p>

<p>Many curious subterranean passages were to be
found on the mountains near Cuzco, the entrances
to which were among picturesque rocks. The Incas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-467" id="Pg_2-467"></a>[<a href="images/2-467.png">467</a>]</span>
seemed to have a regular mania for carving steps
and angular channels in rocks. Not far from the
fortress could be found the place of recreation of the
Incas&mdash;the Rodadeiro&mdash;over which the Incas tobogganed,
perhaps sitting on hides. Thousands and
thousands of people must have gone in for the sport,
as the solid rock was deeply grooved by the friction
of the persons who have slid on it.</p>

<p>The remains of ancient altars for the worship of
the sun and an Inca throne, where the king of the Incas
must have sat while battles were taking place, were
indeed most interesting to examine.</p>

<p>More interesting than any other to me was the particular
spot on the mountain side where a kind of throne
existed carved out of a huge block of rock, and where
a battle of the Incas against their enemies could be
reconstructed. Mounds of ammunition, consisting of
round stones as big as a lawn-tennis ball, had been
accumulated above and near the throne. Just below
that high spot I found scattered upon the mountain
side quantities of ammunition which had evidently
been thrown by the Incas at the attacking foes.</p>

<p>Farther on was the "round table" where the
Incas had their feasts&mdash;a huge circular table of rock
situated near a conical boulder of immense size.</p>

<p>Interesting fountains with carved figure-heads;
an Inca bath of graceful lines; and, some kilometres
beyond Cuzco, the marvellous ruins of Viraccocha at
Tinta, where gigantic walls of a palace were to be seen
standing, and ruins of other fortresses filled one with
amazement.</p>

<p>On the mountain side near the town were the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-468" id="Pg_2-468"></a>[<a href="images/2-468.png">468</a>]</span>
strange gateways of Choquechaca, which in their
lines resembled ancient Egyptian buildings. Not far
off were the blocks of rock to which the Incas fastened
their prisoners by their legs, arms and heads, and
exposed them to the ridicule of the populace.</p>

<p>Many were the wonderful things which had been
found in digging near Cuzco; but most interesting of
all to me were the deformed crania&mdash;some flattened
to almost an incredible extent on the top, others
elongated backward to an amazing degree, others
still with the central part of the skull deeply depressed,
so as to form two globular swellings at the sides.
Others, again, had been squeezed so as to form an
angular ridge longitudinally on the summit. One
skull particularly interested me, which had a pronounced
elongation backward, and a dent just above
the forehead which must have been caused by tying
the cranium while young and still in a soft condition.
Most of the skulls were of gigantic size when compared
with those of modern times. The lower part was under-developed.
Many of them possessed magnificent teeth.</p>

<p>Several of the skulls had been trephined, evidently
while the person was still alive, some of the perforations
in the brain-case being circular in shape, others
quadrangular&mdash;most of the trephinations having been
made in the forehead, others on the top of the skull.
I saw one skull with as many as eleven apertures
thus made. The operation had evidently been performed
by a very able surgeon, for the little cap of
bone removed fitted beautifully into the opening that
had been made.</p>

<p>The Incas were great architects. They had an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-469" id="Pg_2-469"></a>[<a href="images/2-469.png">469</a>]</span>
absolute craving for carving rock. They made models
of their fortresses and palaces in blocks of hard stone,
some of these being of remarkable perfection in their
detail.</p>

<p>The pottery, red earthen vessels with geometrical
designs upon them, was most interesting, especially the
large jars which must have been used for fermenting
wine. Those jars of a typical shape must have rested
on a pedestal of wood, as they ended in a point
at the bottom, which prevented their standing up
on a flat surface. Two handles were attached to the
lower part of those jars, and also to the great bottles
in which they kept wine.</p>

<p>The Incas used tumblers, enamelled in red and
green, and of most graceful shape.</p>

<p>They were fond of ornamenting their bottles and
vessels with representations of human heads, reproduced
with considerable artistic fidelity. Other bottles represented
strange gnawing faces, with expanded eyes and a
fierce moustache.</p>

<p>Judging from the representations of figures on
their jars, the people in those days wore their hair
in little plaits round the head. Heads of llamas
sculptured in stone or else modelled in earthenware
were used as vessels.</p>

<p>The Incas made serviceable mortars for grinding
grain, of polished hard rock, mostly of a circular
shape, seldom more than two feet in diameter.</p>

<p>The matrimonial stone was interesting enough.
It was a double vessel carved out of a solid stone, a
perforation being made in the partition between the
two vessels. It seems, when marriages were per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-470" id="Pg_2-470"></a>[<a href="images/2-470.png">470</a>]</span>formed,
that the Incas placed a red liquid in one
vessel and some water in the other, the perforation
in the central partition being stopped up until the
ceremony took place, when the liquids were allowed
to mingle in emblem of the union of the two lives.
Curious, too, was the pipe-like arrangement, called
the <i>kenko</i>, ornamented with a carved jaguar head,
also used at their marriage ceremonies.</p>

<p>Their stone axes and other implements were
of extraordinary interest&mdash;their rectangularly-shaped
stone knives, the star- and cross-shaped heads for
their war clubs, as well as the star-shaped weights
which they used for offensive purposes, attached,
perhaps, to a sling. Many were the weapons of offence
made of stone which have been found near Cuzco,
some of which were used by holding in the hand,
others attached to sticks.</p>

<p>The Incas were fairly good sculptors, not only
in stone but also in moulding human figures and
animals in silver and gold. Llamas, deer, long-nosed
human-faced idols were represented by them with
fidelity of detail, although perhaps not so much
accuracy in the general proportions. At a later date
the Incas used metal implements, such as small rakes
and chisels for smoothing rock. They made hair-pins
and ear-rings, chiefly of a mixture of gold, silver,
lead and copper.</p>

<p>I saw at Cuzco a stone arrangement which was
used by the Incas for washing and milling gold. Many
ornaments of silex, agate and emerald, and also of
coral, which had evidently been brought there from
the coast, have also been found near Cuzco.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-471" id="Pg_2-471"></a>[<a href="images/2-471.png">471</a>]</span>
The spoons and knives which the Incas used were
generally made of gold, with representations of heads
attached to them. The average length of these
articles was from two to four inches.</p>

<p>I left the city on Friday, February 16th, going back
the way I had come as far as the junction of Juliaca.</p>

<p>The Cuzco railway, to my mind, crosses the most
beautiful and most interesting scenery of any railway
I have ever seen. It is a pity that more English
people do not travel by it. The great elevation
makes people suffer from mountain-sickness, and that
perhaps deters many travellers from attempting the
journey. The railway has to contend with great
natural difficulties&mdash;land-slides, which often stop traffic
for days at a time, being frequent.</p>

<p>From Cuzco I went direct to Lake Titicaca, where
more Inca ruins, such as the cylindrical towers of
Sillistayni, existed at Puno. Lake Titicaca is a heavenly
sheet of water, situated at an elevation by hypsometrical
apparatus of 12,202 ft. With its magnificent
background of snowy peaks, the lake looked indeed
too impressive for words, as I steamed across it in
the excellent steamer of the Peruvian Corporation.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of February 17th, having
travelled the entire night in order to cross the lake
from north to south, we arrived at Guaqui, the port
for La Paz, the capital of Bolivia. Although I travelled
in the most luxurious comfort, owing to the kindness
of the Peruvian Corporation, the journey by rail
and the going about examining the ruins at Cuzco
had tired me considerably. My brain was so exhausted
that it would really take in no more.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-472" id="Pg_2-472"></a>[<a href="images/2-472.png">472</a>]</span>
Worse luck, when I reached La Paz it was during
carnival time, when it was impossible to go out of
the hotel without being smothered in cornflour or
chalk, and sprinkled with aniline dyed water. Even
bottles of ink were emptied on one's head from the
windows. So that, although I crossed Bolivia from
one end to the other in its longest part, I was unable
to do any further work. I tried to get down to the
coast as quickly as possible in order to return home.</p>

<p>La Paz was a beautiful city, extremely neat, with
bright red-tiled roofs and white buildings. It was
situated in a deep hollow surrounded by a great
barrier of mountains. So deep and sudden was the
hollow that within a few metres of its upper edge one
would never suppose a town to be at hand. Bolivia
is a go-ahead country in which English people are
greatly interested. We have in our Minister there,
Mr. Gosling, a very able representative of British
interests.</p>

<p>Bolivians have shown great enterprise in building
railways in all directions in order properly to develop
their enormously wealthy country. Many important
lines are in construction; others are projected&mdash;of
which, perhaps, the most interesting will be the one
from Santa Cruz to Corumba on the Brazilian boundary.</p>

<p>The day will come when the port of Arica on the
Pacific Ocean will be joined to Oruro, on the Antofagasta
line, the well-known junction in Bolivia,
and eventually to Santa Cruz. The present plan is
to build a line from the already existing railway at
Cochabamba to Porto Velarde on the Rio Grande
(Rio Mamore), then to Santa Cruz. The Brazilians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-473" id="Pg_2-473"></a>[<a href="images/2-473.png">473</a>]</span>
on their side will eventually connect S&atilde;o Paulo with
Cuyaba and Corumba. It will then be possible to
travel by rail right across the South American continent
in its richest part.</p>

<p>There is also a project of connecting Santa
Cruz with Embarcacion and Campo Santo, in the
Argentine Republic, and eventually with the Trans-Andine
Railway.</p>

<p>Other smaller lines projected are those between
Potos&iacute; and Sucre, and one from the Chilian boundary
at La Quiada to Tarija. That system of railways
will greatly develop the entire southern portion of
Bolivia. A small railway is also proposed in the
most northern part of the Republic, between Riberalta
on the River Madre de Dios and Guajara Merim on the
Madeira-Mamore railway, a district of immense wealth
for the production of rubber.</p>

<p>The exact elevation of La Paz by hypsometrical
apparatus was 12,129 ft.</p>

<p>I left La Paz on February 21st, and travelled through
flat, alluvial, uninteresting country&mdash;only a huge flock
of llamas or vicu&ntilde;as enlivening the landscape here
and there, or a group of Indians in their picturesque
costumes. The women, with their green, violet or
red shawls and much-pleated short skirts, generally
blue, afforded particularly gay patches of colour.</p>

<p>I saw a beautiful effect of mirage near the lake
in the vicinity of Oruro, as I was on the railway to
Antofagasta. We were going through flat country
most of the time. It had all the appearance of
having once been a lake bottom. Perhaps that great
Titicaca Lake formerly extended as far south as Lake<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-474" id="Pg_2-474"></a>[<a href="images/2-474.png">474</a>]</span>
Poopo, which is connected with Lake Titicaca by the
River Desaguadero. In fact, if I am not far wrong,
the two lakes formed part, in days gone by, of one
single immense lake. The mountains on our right as we
went southwards towards Oruro showed evidence that
the level of the then united lakes must have reached,
in days gone by, some 150 ft. higher than the plain
on which we were travelling. The low undulations
on our left had evidently been formed under water
in the lake bottom.</p>

<p>The junction of Oruro, from which the Cochabamba
railway branches, was quite a large place, of 8,000
inhabitants, but with no particularly striking buildings.
Tin and silver mining was carried on in the surrounding
mountains.</p>

<p>From Oruro I continued the journey to Antofagasta
via Uyuni. Immense deposits of borax were to be
seen all along the line from the station of Ulaca;
then we came to a most beautiful sight&mdash;the volcano
of Ollag&uuml;e, 12,123 ft. above the sea level. It looked
like a giant dome, snow-capped, and smoking on
its southern side. Its slopes were fairly regular, and
of most brilliant colouring, red and blue. Near the
volcano were mounds of mud and shattered rock.
Ollag&uuml;e stood on the boundary between Bolivia and
Chile.</p>

<p class="fsc">On the Andes.</p>
<hr />
<p>After passing San Martin, the first station on the
Chilian side, the railway skirted the bed of an ancient
lake, an immense circular flat stretch with deposits
of sand and borax, in which could be seen occasional
pools of stagnant water. On the west side stood a
high three-peaked mountain covered with snow, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-475" id="Pg_2-475"></a>[<a href="images/2-475.png">475</a>]</span>
at the southern end of that plain was a charming
lakelet. We had no sooner left this beautiful view
than we had before us to the south-west an immense
conical mountain, flat-topped. It looked just like
the well-known Fujiyama of Japan, only more regular
in its sloping lines.</p>

<p>We passed the works of a Borax Company, which
were between the stations of Sebollar and Ascotan.
There was to be seen another immense lake of borax,
some 40 kil. (24 miles) long.</p>

<p>I arrived that evening at Antofagasta, and was
fortunate enough to get on board one of the Pacific
Mail Line steamers the next morning on my way to
Valparaiso. We were now in the height of civilization
again&mdash;very hot, very uncomfortable, very ambitious,
very dirty, the hotels abominable. Had it not been
for the kindness of friends I should have fared badly
indeed in Valparaiso, for the place was invaded by a
swarm of American tourists, who had just landed
from an excursion steamer and rendered the place
unbearable.</p>

<p>From Valparaiso, as soon as it was possible to
obtain accommodation, I travelled across the Andes
and as far as Buenos Aires by the Trans-Andine
railway. The scenery on this line was most disappointing
to any one who has seen the Andes in their
real grandeur farther north; but for the average
traveller the journey may prove interesting enough,
although hot, dull, dusty, and not particularly comfortable.</p>

<p>While I was travelling on the railway between
Mendoza and Buenos Aires there was a serious strike<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-476" id="Pg_2-476"></a>[<a href="images/2-476.png">476</a>]</span>
of railway employ&eacute;s. The railway had been attacked
at many different points. Amateur engineers
and attendants ran the trains. We were only two
hours from Buenos Aires. The heat and dust were
intense as we crossed the great pampas. The shaking
of the train had tired me to such an extent that I
placed a pillow on the ledge of the open window,
and was fast asleep with my head half outside the
carriage, when I woke up startled by the sound of
an explosion. I found myself covered with quantities
of d&eacute;bris of rock. A huge stone, as big as a man's
head or bigger, had been thrown with great force at
the passing train by the strikers, and had hit the
side of my window only about three inches above my
head, smashing the woodwork and tearing off the metal
frame of the window. Had it struck a little lower it
would have certainly ended my journey for good.</p>

<p class="fsc">Borax Deposits, Bolivia.</p>
<hr />
<p>As it was I arrived in Buenos Aires safely. A
few days later I was on my way to Rio de Janeiro,
by the excellent steamer <i>Aragon</i>. Shortly after, by
the equally good vessel <i>Araguaya</i>, of the Royal Mail
Steamship Company, I returned to England, where I
arrived in broken health on April 20th, 1912. It
was a relief to me to land at Southampton, with all my
notes, the eight hundred photographs I had taken, and
the maps which I had made of the regions traversed.</p>
